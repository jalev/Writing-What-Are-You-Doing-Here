## Canton 15: Rivers Gets into Twohorn's Confidence

Despite Twohorn telling Adjutant Rivers not to do anything _subversive_, he'd gone ahead and done _the_ most subversive thing possible in this day and age- mediated the assassination of the most _powerful political figure_ in the Parliament, and succeeded. All while everyone was sound asleep, and after the Human had escaped, which, to give him some credit was a feat in and of itself in the Twohorn's books.

What had made Rivers assassinate Bounty in the first place? Perhaps it was the presence of the Human that made him take the risk? Or- and this is what Twohorn thought to be the case- Rivers had just simply seen a series of events and took advantage of them.

Twohorn had found out about the assassination when a panicked soldier had broken into their sparse sleeping quarters while it was still dark, and much to the objections of the house-staff. They stammered an incomprehensible stream of words about the event before being dragged out by apologetic house-staff. This was followed up by another soldier- and another loud objection- breaking in through another door, and throwing a report onto their lap before being carried out by an apologetic Yellowrock.

There, in very big font on the first page; Bountiful Fields had been assassinated. _Assassinated_! And whatever sleepiness still lingered in Twohorn fled immediately as those five words ignited memories and very almost a heart attack. Twohorn jumped out of bed and ran out of the room, barking orders at Yellowrock- who still carried the irate soldier on her shoulder- to go fetch a list of fellows, forcibly if needs be. Yellowstone and the soldier- who despite not being house-staff and still considered themselves useful to the task- saluted and bounded away.

The _Plan_- the one which everyone, including Twohorn, had forgotten about- was back on. Twohorn felt _alive_ again- well, as much _alive_ as an old Shk with no colour could feel like. Things were _happening_. But as a stretch passed, and many angry Shk passed through their door and were shuffled into the grand stateroom with the promise of wine, the high of excitement Twohorn felt had wore off into a sober anxiety, manifesting itself as pacing around nervously in their waiting room trying to put their thoughts in order. A trail of smokeweed formed a thick orange line behind them as they tried to stuff a brimming smoking-pipe to pass the periods.

The guests- who Twohorn grouped together as _Conspirators_ to sound much more cohesive- were influential Shk in the intersecting social circles that Twohorn mingled in. They were the esteemed capitalists and bankers (to fund the venture and be granted concessions in return), the key politicians in several large parties (to lay a lasting political foundation), and the Military-Wing generals whom Twohorn shared ideologies with (and who were going to shoot anyone that blew dust up about the coup). Twenty Shk in all- 7 Politicians, Capitalists, and Military-Wings (including themself). And despite the _Conspirators'_ humming and hawing over the rotations, their support would make sure that everything would be in its proper place when the dust settled. Assuming anyone actually remembered there even _was_ a plan. Because the Conspirators definitely appeared to prefer drinking their wine over discussing how to overthrow the Parliament.

Twohorn hoped that the theatre they were about to put on- which would explain to them the situation- would spring them back into action, and if it didn't, well, Twohorn still had their Oaths. The Conspirators were honour-bound to never talk about the Plan outside of this small group. So Twohorn was confident that the details would never leak, even after they buried the detritus of the Conspirator's exploded remains into a hole somewhere.

Yellowrock walked through the door to the stateroom, startling Twohorn enough to blow the orange contents of the smoking-pipe out into a small cloud that thankfully missed their uniform. The noise of twenty agitated Shk filled the small room like hot wine before Yellowrock slammed the door shut and stood to attention.

"Twohorn, Ser," Yellowrock said solemnly as she threw up a salute, studiously blocking the door.

"I guess they've not calmed," Twohorn said, automatically taking out another wad of smokeweed from a pocket and stuffing it into the pipe.

"No, Ser, they ain't. Might I venture'n opinion, Ser?"

"Sure, why not."

"I'd not feed them any more wine. They're angry in a way that getting drunk only makes worse, Ser. The rage swirlin' in there is like a tempest of soupy moods, ain't it? And the mood could move well away from whatever it was you was intending to do by bringing them up so early. I'd not try and walk in there with an attitude unless... unless I knew for a fact my wings were strong enough to carry me through it, like. Ser."

Twohorn blinked stupidly as they lit the pipe, processing the statements. "That's a... very... descriptive assessment of the situation, Yellowrock," they said as they took a tentative drag from the pipe.

"Oh thank you Ser, When you mentioned you liked my poetry I decided to spend some off-time working on it, Ser. Been reading all kinds of books, Ser. Definitely getting the feel fer it, Ser," Yellowrock beamed, then saw Twohorn's vacant look at remembered themselves. "But, er, the reason I came out here, Ser, is because one of the guests has broken your Globe, Ser. I warned him I did. I told him 'Don't you go touching that Globe, Ser is _very_ fond of it, as it came from their late partner, Ser,' but did he listen? No Ser. After he stomped on it a few times he uttered a line to the room about yourself and your late partner that I daren't repeat, Ser."

Anxiety was forcibly shoved to the ground by anger. "Which one was it?" Twohorn said as they bit the lip of the smoking-pipe, having a clear idea of who it might be. Yellowstone and the rest of the house-staff here in the house had learned when not to look at things, and the appropriate times to be overly observant.

"Representative Functional Capitalism, Ser," Yellowrock said. Functional Capitalism- leader of the Honourable Opposition to the Council of Queens- had been trying to jostle themselves into a greater position of authority in the group of Conspirators for some time now. This little offence was an attempt to focus the spotlight on himself while testing how far he could get away with.

"Thanks for the update," Twohorn said coolly, barely managing to stop themselves from shouting. "Now if you don't mind moving _aside_, I've got a Representative to _talk_ to." Yellowrock had barely turned before Twohorn- not half her size- pushed past. 

The atmosphere in the stateroom wasn't so much a '_tempest of soupy moods_' as Yellowrock described as it was several loud, very incoherent arguments that drifted past Twohorn as they strode purposefully towards the throng. Twohorn ignored the somewhat tipsy crowd as they flicked a set of eyes to the Globe. It had been murdered most brutally, with the skin of the thing ripped apart, and the skeleton dismembered clumsily. The Conspirators had conspicuously moved away from the crime-scene, and slightly further away from the brightly-robed figure of Functional Capitalism to form a semi-circular gap around him.

When someone finally spotted the slow-moving white bullet coming towards them, the group swayed as a whole and conversation died out unexpectedly, though it didn't stop Capitalism from blustering through some tale of his, though he too recognised to turn around. When his eyes spotted Twohorn approaching, he brightened up considerably.

"Is your leashed _grublet_ here yet? As much as I like your hearth and your wine, I'd very much like to _fuck_ my partner if it's all the same to you," Capitalism slurred in exceptionally bad taste. His colourful bed-dress fluttered about as he downed a glassful of wine, dribbling some of it onto an already wine-splotched cloth.

That Capitalism was drunk made Twohorn angrier. Without thinking about the possible repercussions, they strode up to the Representative and yanked their bed-dress with a beating arm. Capitalism squeaked in surprise as they rocked forward, and then fell to the side as Twohorn's other beating-arm slammed into the side of his head. Capitalism hit the carpet with an audible thump, followed by more meaty sounding 'thwumps' as Twohorn's boot met flesh.

"You! Will! Behave! Like! Your! _Damn_! _Position_! _Demands_!" Twohorn snarled between each kick. And they would have kept on kicking to multiply the damage done to that priceless Globe if Yellowrock hadn't stuck their head into the room at that moment.

"Ser, the Adjutant is here, Ser," Yellowrock said very loudly up at the ceiling to get Twohorn's attention, but pointedly ignoring the beating. Twohorn hissed loudly and turned to the Conspirators, pointing at a groaning Capitalism.

"Does anyone _else_ want to make a scene? Break my things? Besmirch my _honour_ in such a tasteless way? Well? _Well_?" They caught snippets of an apologetic murmur, but no takers. "Good. I _apologise_ for waking you all so early, but please, _wait_ for a few periods more, and then we will begin. What I have to say is _very important_. And _someone_ please put the Representative into a chair and wave some wine under his horn. I want him awake before we start," Twohorn said, and then spun on their heels and left the room, slamming the door behind them. They clenched their fists, biting down hard on the stem of the pipe, and took a deep drag to calm themselves down again. "_Damn Politicians_," they muttered.

"Erm, Ser," Yellowstone began, but was cut off before she could start with a look.

"_Where is he?_" Twohorn said coolly.

"I'll... I'll go fetch him," Yellowstone said as she bounded off, and returned moments later with Rivers in tow. Despite his sleepy look- which Twohorn had come to realise over the weeks was Rivers' default expression- he dressed as though ready to march for Parade. He threw a salute when in front of Twohorn, and then waited patiently to be spoken to.

"Go watch the grublets, Yellowstone," Twohorn said levelly. Yellowstone saluted and stepped through into the stateroom in a smooth motion.

Blood was still pumping, and against _all_ urges to rip Rivers' head off, Twohorn sighed. "So. Bounty is dead."

"Yes ser," Rivers said as a confirmation. His face remained impassive, but he stood a little more firmly to attention. Acquaintances had told Twohorn on several occasions that Rivers had the gaze of a servant- a good thing to have in a subordinate, according to them at least. Twohorn didn't know what a 'Servant's gaze' was on account of not having any. What he came to believe it meant was that Rivers' expression was almost completely unreadable most of the time. 

On the other hands, Twohorn had figured out by looking at the Adjutant speaking that he telegraphed his feelings more visibly than a lightning strike. So while Rivers had been trained not to react to things in the usual way, paying attention to his _body language_, especially when trying to get information _out_ of him, was much more productive than asking.

And it was a good thing they'd figured out his ticks, because Twohorn needed to get answers as to _why_ Rivers had gone as did what he did, and a wriggling feeling in the back of their mind told them that the Adjutant wasn't going to be very forthcoming with an answer.

"What of Representative Grass?" Twohorn had read the name in the report, and the slim document attached about who the Representative was. The lack of any real information on them raised quite a lot of flags in Twohorn's mind. How _does_ a no-name Representative get a meeting with the most powerful political entity in the Parliament?

"Disappeared after the event," Rivers said truthfully. "We're conducting a search alongside the Capital Police." The first lie. Why was he lying about _that_ of all things? The report said that co-operation was happening. Perhaps it was to do with Grass themselves? Did Rivers know what happened to Grass?

"Anyone else involved?"

"No Ser, only the agents," Rivers said, but the body betrayed. The second lie. Twohorn bit down on their pipe.

"Why did Bounty come to the office?"

"To inquire after Gemstone, Ser." Another truth. "She wanted to know when Gemstone was being released. I spun her a tale about Gemstone being injured, and that she was recovering. The Representative was very vocal on her 'Good Breeding' being cause for a speedy recovery."

"And a record of her coming in?"

"None, Ser." Another truth, which Twohorn hid their surprise about. Bounty would have needed to be credentialed by Parliamentary Services in order to see Rivers. And how had he managed to get her to come to the Office in the first place? Bounty was absolutely far too busy with administrative work to have bothered with this completely trivial task.

"I'll admit this all fits together quite neatly, given how little time you had to put things together. Well done, Rivers," Twohorn said offhandedly.

"Thank you Ser."

"Did the Human put you up to this?"

River's body reacted, but his eyes didn't. "No Ser. But, if it makes the sequence of events easier to follow Ser, then I won't refuse it." A truth wrapped up in a snide comment. Something about it rubbed them the wrong way, as though he'd said something along those lines to them before.

"I suppose it will then. The less I know, the better," Twohorn lied, taking another puff before looking back up at Rivers. His stance relaxed a little _too_ much, as though sure he'd gotten away with something, which said as much as was needed. Twohorn stood in silence, revelling at watching Rivers try to figure out what to do next.

What had Rivers said before, on the void-vessel? That he '_had some agendas of his own?_' Twohorn tried to recall how the Adjutant had looked back then when their attention was focused a bit too much on the Political-Wings. Was he haughty? Defiant? What was the _look_ he'd given them, when he suggested his idea about convincing the Political-Wings to give them emergency powers?

A seed of bad ideas was wriggling through the mud of Twohorn's mind at that moment. It was a seed germinated by many decades of rotations of political survival in the Parliament and the Political Wings.

It was a seed that sprouted the suggestion that perhaps it was a bit _too_ timely that Rivers had found themselves as their Adjutant only twenty-or-so rounds before the void-vessel mission finished. Too _organised_ in getting the Political-Wings together for an ad-hoc piece of theatre on the void-vessel. A bit too _certain_ to suggest Twohorn make a play for emergency powers. And _too_ quick to go and get Bounty assassinated when another plan was already in the works.

_Someone_ in the Conspirators was using Twohorn, and was doing it through Rivers. _Someone_ had an exceptionally low opinion about Twohorn's ability to deliver. _Someone_ still thought the plan was viable, and was going to try and ride on their tail, and then neatly get rid of them. And probably most worrying, _someone_ else knew that the _Human_ existed.

"Ser, if I might have an opinion," Rivers asked tentatively.

"Sure, why not."

"Why _am_ I here? I supposed you would want more information about the _event_, but, you have my report on situation. And a debriefing could have waited until much later in the afternoon."

"Oh. Oh _right_, yes," Twohorn said adopting Ringfinger's habit of pretending to be surprised about something- because if there was one thing the former-adjutant was exceptionally good at, it was acting like an idiot. "Well, we're going to have a meeting with my _friends_ in there."

"..._Friends_, Ser?" Rivers hazarded.

"Yes. A group of Friends who will be very interested to hear the news about Bounty being assassinated."

"Ah, _co-conspirators_," Rivers said, making the connection out of nothing, a fact that Twohorn made a mental note of. "What role should I play then?"

"Can you do 'Adjutant who stands around gives reports?'"

"I can definitely do that," Rivers said.

"Good," Twohorn said as they turned to walk into the stateroom, resolving to keep Rivers exceptionally close, and with a knife aimed at his abdomen. They would need to keep a keen eye around him and puzzle out which Conspirators was trying to make a play at things.

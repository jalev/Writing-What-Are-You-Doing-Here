The two Xeno fell into uncharacteristic silence when the radio was switched off. It'd been repeating the same message about the attempted assassination of Bountiful Fields that the Sticks and Stones twins had mentioned. Whoever this Xeno was, they were apparently important enough to make these two clowns stop chittering like a pair of songbirds long enough for Wenjie to think, which in turn, gave her brain to catch up with her body, who had some concerns that needed addressing. 

So instead of trying to chip away at the Xeno's wall of silence with pointed questions pulled out from her arsenal of blissful ignorance, Wenjie instead closed her eyes. After a few seconds of making sure she was secure, she took three slow, deep breaths, and switched off into her own blackness. It was followed a moment later with a thought to Ruslan.
 
'_Can you keep an ear on things? Wake me up if anything bad happens_,' the sleepiness she felt crawled along the thought-connection, which was met by a worried emotional gesture from Ruslan.

_'I understand. But perhaps you should define what_ "Bad" _means in this context? We are in a vehicle with Shk who don't want to harm us,'_ Ruslan thought back, concerned but thrilled at the sudden responsibility.

_'Oh, I don't care, just use your better judgement.'_ Ruslan could _feel_ the exhaustion in the thought.

'_I understand, but I would_-' but the thought-connection terminated before Ruslan could finish. It took pinging the health endpoints of the Vampsuit- which was the name of the spacesuit gave itself and refused to answer to anything else- to find out Wenjie had fallen into what was called a '_comatose state_'. Ruslan consulted the Vampsuit documentation on the matter, and read the state as '_could be a bad thing_'. Vampsuit, in the dry, black humour only a highly specialised spacesuit might have, diagnosed her with '_as healed as she is going to get_.'

Ruslan tried not to be annoyed by being so rudely cut off. What had happened to the Wenjie that had spent all those years in the small corners of time raising them from micro-code? _That_ Wenjie had seemed level-headed, cool, and completely detached from the apparent miseries her body and mind had been subjected to. _This_ Wenjie had... _some_ of those characteristics, but it was hard to see when uncertainty clouded it. 

Perhaps it had something to do with her body? Ruslan pondered this with the the Vampsuit, which gave a very non-committal answer on the subject. As far as that murky mind was concerned, she wasn't dead, but she wasn't much alive either, and perhaps _Emergency Measures_ would be required. Ruslan tried to tease out what that ominous statement meant, but was met with a damning silence, which only made them fret more.

Ruslan forced themselves not to dwell on it by switching contexts. Their sense of time went up several magnitudes and stopped in Wenjie-Time, or, Meat-Realtime as the Vampsuit called it. It was as good a place as any to idle, waiting to react to input. Which, as they thought longer about it, made them especially anxious. They and Wenjie had done nothing but react to events as they came. There just wasn't enough _context_ to make any good decisions. But what could be done about it, other than to continue studiously gathering information? And- Ruslan was definitely keen on this one- asking Wenjie for Vampsuit visual permissions.

After some time, the audio-processor began to take up some computational-cycles, and Ruslan, who had rambled down a corridor of thought- and was well and thoroughly lost- tripped back into their reality through a wall of rhetorical questions. They hadn't come up with a solution to anything, and had only managed to tangle themselves into a bigger ball of anxiety. The audio-processor consuming cycles meant that the Vampsuit microphone was hearing Gemstone and Ringfinger speak. Ruslan dropped down magnitudes of time, and settled into the context of the audio-processor. If anything, the two Shk would at least give them the opportunity to untangle their knots.

"What are you going to do when you get back to the city?" Gemstone asked. Ruslan got a feedback cycle from the Persistent Inflection/Sentiment Scrutiniser- PISS- that although she tried to make it sound like she was bored, there were hints of anxiety being covered up by the bravado.

"Why do you want to know?" Ringfinger said defensively.

"It's seven stretches to the Capital, Ringfinger."

"So? Spend it sleeping or something. I don't care. I'm driving."

Some connections untangled themselves in Ruslan's mesh, letting a thought bubble up. The cultural-dictionary for Humans- rarely used but eager to be useful- suggested they were on a '_Road Trip_', and opened up on a litany. Ruslan began to bubble up with excitement at the potential of new experiences.

"Sleep? Were you _listening_ to what the radio said? Bounty has been _stabbed_, Ringfinger. Though I don't doubt she'll make it through this, think of the _chaos_ created in her absence!" Gemstone exclaimed, and the PISS unmasked the subtle worry in her voice.

Ruslan idly updated their list of names, creating a connection between Bountiful and Gemstone, and Bounty with Bountiful. An idea surfaced, pushing past the layers of mush that made up Ruslan, tearing through the skin of themselves like a swimmer gaping for air.

Wouldn't it be incredible if there was something that generated context. Context. Context _generator_. Something automated that could keep track of the relationships between what was known and what was said. It could hook into the audio-processor and PISS, and perhaps, with enough context, you might ask questions and get a probability likelihood of something else happening.

Wasn't everything just a graphing problem after all?

Ruslan metaphorically grabbed the idea, increased their brain-computational share, and dived deeper into the magnitudes of time. They opened their virtual development environment and began to play. About 40 milliseconds later- which passed like days- a simple tree had been formed containing only a small canopy of statements connected by weak grey branches. It looked like the beginnings of a bonsai-tree- if someone had tried to design one by description.

Satisfied with their handiwork, Ruslan spent a little longer connecting the context-generator to the audio-processor, and then played back all audio logs available to them. The context-generator glowed as it was fed. Once this process was over, Ruslan de-prioritised themselves. Time began to move up the magnitudes, back into the time-space of the audio-processor.

"My heart bleeds for you," Ringfinger said.

"You could at least show some sympathy to my plight you reprobate. Have you really never had someone you cared for hurt before?"

There was a long pause, after which Ringfinger sighed again. Potential facts slid into the context-generator as it lit up, the program creeping up into Ruslan's thought-space, begging for attention.

_'Ringfinger has someone they care about.'_

_'Gemstone cares about Bountiful Fields.'_

_'Gemstone detests Ringfinger.'_

It didn't take a context-generator to realise any of these things, but Ruslan approved the statements anyway. The power of this program would be when there were enough linked facts to ask it questions, and it wouldn't do to be too peculiar about the content this early. They even allowed themselves the hope that perhaps after this road-trip, some mystery of Shk Culture might be revealed. Wenjie would definitely praise them for cracking that problem.

"Right. Ok. Well. What was the question again?" Ringfinger said.

"What do you intend to do when you get back to the Capital? I realise now that I actually know nothing about you other than your work with Twohorn."

"That would be because I tried _very_ hard to keep my personal life out of my work, not that it did me any good. Seems to follow me wherever I go."

"Oh?"

"What do you mean _oh_? Don't act so stupid. I've heard you and everyone else throw around _gutter-mite_ behind my back. You're one of the reasons why I can't ever _forget_ my personal history."

"That's because..."

"I _am_ one? You could have just left it at _commoner_, but no, you all had to go make an insult out of it. You're all the same you Representatives, all caring about titles and where you were born. The only ones that do any more."

"It was a joke, Ringfinger." A pause, then. "Fine, fine, I concede the point," Gemstone said, in a tone that the PISS recognized as being that she didn't actually care that much. "I apologise for calling you a _Gutter-mite_."

"Thanks," Ringfinger said hollowly.

While all this was happening, the context-generator had presented some more facts for Ruslan to approve. They were ecstatic to learn the fact there existed a substantial class-divide between these two Shk, by wealth and/or some social distinction. Ruslan had already puzzled this out based on conversations in the space-ship, but it was still very promising for the context-generator to suss it out. It meant that perhaps they had been right to create this program.

"Still, you've only been in the Military-Wing for what, ten rotations? And you're not exactly a budding sprig by my estimations. You must have been doing _something_ before enlisting. Perhaps some studies, or a trade, or something of that nature," Gemstone pushed. The context-generator had updated to say that Gemstone possibly loved to hear the sound of her own voice. Ruslan dismissed it, being picky.

"I did a little bit of everything."

"Now that's the kind of vagueness that keeps a conversation going, Ringfinger," Gemstone said sarcastically.

"I'm serious. Back in the slums I did a little bit of _everything_. Carpenter. Bouncer. Bone-fixer every now and then. But I spent most of my time as a mechanic."

"_You_ did all _that_? Really?"

"Why's that so surprising?"

"Well, because, look at where you ended up! I would have thought someone who landed in the role of Adjutant for Twohorn would have been classically trained for the role. Mind you, this _does_ go to explain some of the more annoying behaviours you keep."

"Oh? And what might _those_ be?"

"Well, if you must know; one of the more prominent complaints about you is that you had no idea about how to act in a formal and diplomatic manner. Why, when I and Bounty were interviewing you for my role in the Space programme, we had to fight to keep a straight face as you committed one mistake after another. We had thought that you were simply acting like an idiot to put us off- it wouldn't have been beyond Twohorn to do such a thing. It provided quite a lot of entertainment I must say. But now? I know you were just being true to yourself. It is quite admirable you managed for so long."

"Well I'm glad I delivered," Ringfinger said coldly.

"Oh come on now Ringfinger, don't be so serious. There's only so much one can expect from a _commoner_. One who happened to trade in everything, but be a master in none of them. I must admit, I am just a bit curious as to how you found your _calling_ as a mechanic, seeing as where you found your career ending."

"I _just_ so happened to _enjoy_ fixing things," Ringfinger hissed. "When you live in the slums, you don't have much of a choice about what your profession is. You do the job in front of you, and if you're good at it, word gets around. We all rely on each other in there, because ain't no one else coming to help us that's for damn sure."

"And how did you end up in the Military-Wing? Was it perhaps to improve on the skills which you thought you had so that you could better help your neighbours? To perhaps make a trade out of it? I have heard this is something that the Military-Wing is particularly good at- setting Shk up in trade skills."

"No. I didn't join because of that."

"No? I'm a bit confused then. Why _did_ you join the Military-Wing, if not to upskill yourself? Many if not all commoners join the Military-Wing due to this particular reason. Surely there must have been a point to your joining?"

"Living in the slums is hard. Harder than _you_ could ever imagine. The _sickness_. The _hungers_. The _violence_. No Representative wanting to touch your district. And the Municipal Police hanging around the corners, batons in hand, ready to break your digits at a moments notice. Me and Purge lost..." Ringfinger forced themselves to stop, collected themselves. "There's only so much one can take before they start to get angry. That's how I ended up in the Military-Wing. Anger, and a want to improve things not just for myself, but for my friends, too."

"Purge?"

"A slip of the tongue. They're not important."

"Really now. Well then Ringfinger I thought I was about to hear something noble. I'm a little disappointed."

"I don't need your approval for my actions."

"Oh, don't get me wrong Ringfinger, I am under _no_ illusion you need anything from me; it's just the fact of the matter is you don't join the Military-Wing to change things _outside_ it. Not unless you were going to change _yourself_ and use that to change things _around you_. But that's small scale. If you wanted to effect some _real_ change, you should have gone the route of being a Representative for your district."

"Run for Representative? You _must_ be joking," Ringfinger said, the PISS extracting the colourful tenors of incredulity in his voice. And after a long pause; "You're not. Gods above you're not."

"And what is _that_ supposed to mean, Ringfinger?"

"You expect someone in the slums to try and run for Representative? Go on then; tell me how one should go about that."

"You make this sound like it will be much more complex than it actually is, Ringfinger. You simply need to own a little property, and then convince those voters in your district to vote for you. Not as complex as you think. I don't see what's so difficult to understand. _I've_ run and won in my district three consecutive times!"

"Well Gemstone, I don't _own_ any property. _Nobody_ in my district does. Nobody in _any_ slum in the Capital does. Gods Above, d'y.ou think we all have stacks of cash laying around that we sit on?"

"No, but I fail to see the problem you're trying to make out, Ringfinger: if you don't have a vested interest in running it, you should not have a say. If you don't have property, you have not bought a stake into the running of things, and subsequently should not be given a voice in its management."

"Yeah? How do you figure that then? Even though we pay our taxes, we don't get a say in things? Don't that strike you as a little bit odd?"

"Taxes are necessary for the functioning of the Parliament, Ringfinger, and by extension, the very society that it helps to organise. It is the social contract that you unconditionally signed by willingly participating in it. You abide by the obligations of that social-contract."

"And you don't think taxes- which as you yourself have said are necessary for the functioning of Parliament- are a literal investment into the system?"

"I must say Ringfinger, I am surprised that they didn't teach you any civics in whatever education you received as a grublet. There exists not only a _property_ requirement, but also _tax threshold_ if you cannot meet the former. It's just that the property threshold is much easier to reach than the tax. Besides, the Commoners pay such a _paltry_ amount of tax in the first place that it can _hardly_ be considered an investment worthy of a say in the way things are run.

"The system is set up this way to prevent the rabble from doing whatever they _please_! It's _simple_, really. We can't have any Shk with an opinion who don't have a stake in the way things are to look after its own interests. Commoners only care about what's in front of their horn. This is one of the many reasons why they cannot be trusted with something as complex as the functioning of Government. Why, what would happen if we _did_ let the Common folk vote? Their minds would be swayed by the less admirable of society. And what would happen, eventually? A return to _absolute monarchy_ is what, and that definitely isn't happening."

"Gods above, if your view of commoners got any narrower and small-minded-"

"Well, it's _not_, Ringfinger. If the poorest cannot pull themselves out of their situation, then they cannot be trusted to govern. It's as _simple_ as _that_."

"And _I'm_ getting tired of hearing that line of reasoning trotted out by Shk who've never had to work a day in their life."

"Don't blame others for your own shortcomings Ringfinger," Gemstone chided. "Again, I circle back to my point of just meeting the property requirements. If you had met that, then I don't think we would have gust around to this topic."

"You think we ain't tried? I _can't_ get myself any property. There _ain't_ none to buy; not even a room in the slum-tower I lived in because it's wholly owned by Politicians and Rent-Seekers." 

"Pish-posh Ringfinger, you simply haven't looked hard enough. There's plenty of property to go around."

"You rich folk gobble any and all property like a big, greedy grublet! Of course someone who _has_ would tell someone who _hasn't_ that things are fine. Keep doing it long enough and everyone will start to believe it-"

"You needn't start taking that tone, Ringfinger."

"-And even _if_ I managed, and I found the money to run as Representative, I'd still have to deal with the fact that my district- all districts for that matter- are so fragmented that it would be a miracle to find the Shk needed to vote for me in the first place."

"_That_ is a very spurious accusation to make, Ringfinger. The districts are set there for a reason. You can't complain that the districting has been badly drawn up because you cannot have your way with things. Honestly, you _commoners_ want to have your cake and eat it too. The districting is carefully reviewed each rotation to make sure that all those _eligible_ to vote can sure that they will be voting for someone who actually represents them. It is a _just_ system to ensure fairness."

"Really. Well, tell you what then. Lets have an example of this _just_ system you speak of. I live in district 0-5-3-0. Do you know who's the  Representative for it?"

"You'll have to forgive me, Ringfinger. I have never visited the slums, or travelled out of the city much for that matter. Is it perhaps, ah, Representative Flowery Law-giving Banks?"

"It is. Now, tell me. Where was Flowery originally born?"

"I wouldn't know, I haven't had the need to interact with them. I would assume the same district? I suppose you're about to tell me something otherwise."

"No. They're registered in district 1-7-3-5-1. _That_ District already has a Representative, and a rich one at that. So when Flowery wanted to run, he found himself priced out. But Flowery's got some friends in the Parliament, and they all happen to have some property in my slum-district. A few property swaps later, Flowery meets the property requirements for the district, and runs, and no surprise, he wins."

"So? I don't get your point. You have described ordinary business to me."

"My _point_ is that unless you were part of the club to begin with, you never had a chance at getting in. And when you're in, there is _no_ incentive to do anything for the district that elected you."

"Just because your Representative isn't from where your born it doesn't mean that you are not represented, Ringfinger. In fact I find it a bit disingenuous that you would assume this to the case, Ringfinger. In fact, if Representatives didn't move around then the outer districts would never have any representation to begin with! The system we have ensures that all districts have representation. It's a fundamental pillar to how things work!"

"Yeah? So why's my district still marked as a slum-zone then? I know for a fact that the Housing-Funding Committee approved the funds for rebuilding the entire Slum-Ring fifteen rotations ago," Ringfinger hissed.

Ruslan decided to detach themselves from the audio-processor as the conversation drifted into deeper political arguments, and the context-generator lit up like someone with a lazy finger holding the rapid-fire trigger down on an ICU issue las-pistol.

Up until this point, Ruslan recalled all mention of Politics by the Shk being especially muted. Even the context-generator didn't get much information on the matter out of the entire audio recordings available to them. There was a lot of information about the _processes_, but not how things _really_ worked. And though Wenjie had taught them about Politics- about how two or more parties just discussed things until consensus- the level of vitriol between Ringfinger and Gemstone made Ruslan start pondering that perhaps they were taught the textual definition of politics, but not real-world examples.

Ruslan- putting on their literally-metaphorical intelligence officer hat- dropped a magnitude into time to begin researching the Politics of humans. After several micro-hours, they had come to the rather reductionist point of view that Biologicals were just too confusing to understand, and that expending so much energy over what amounted to a consensus problem seemed especially wasteful. But- at least Ringfinger and Gemstone's animosity towards each other started to make more sense now.

Ruslan bubbled up magnitudes of time, and attached themselves back onto the audio-processor. It was 60-real-minutes of process-idle before Gemstone spoke up.

"So you joined the Military-Wing to try and change things?"

"Yes."

"Were... you successful?"

"No."

"Why was that exactly?"

"You know why. The Military-Wing's packed with rich folk looking to get a pension and some fancy honours. Quite a lot of privileges locked up in the Military-Wing it turns out. Nobody's keen on giving any of them up. Changing the Military-Wing is just as impossible as changing the Parliament."

"Well, Ringfinger, perhaps the reason you were unable to instrument any kind of change was because you were attached to Twohorn. Simply put, despite their stellar historical record in the Revolution and after, they're still a political disaster. They have no influence to affect anything other than the date of their resignation, something, which I might add, you helped to prolong. What you should have done, was to convince them to tender their resignation and taken their place. You could have had much more of a say in things at that level of influence."

"Twohorn is one of the most stable Shk in a position of power I've had the pleasure of working with," Ringfinger said levelly. "It's because of them that I even managed to get to where I got in the first place. I _won't_ have you talk about them like they're some sort of doddering fool gliding to the grave."

This set Gemstone off, and the two Shk went straight back into arguing. Ruslan tuned out again, keeping their attention on the context-generator for anything interesting as facts trickled in about Twohorn. They were an outcast and a publicly popular one at that. The General's accomplishments created a large list that Ruslan had no context for understanding, but was impressed by nonetheless, given that their own list was only five items long. 

It was also during the argument and the organising of Twohorn facts that the audio-processor experienced a slight uptick in processing requirements. Ruslan ignored this for some time, thinking it was to do with the arguments these two were having. But when the processing-requirements continued to increase, they decided to focus in on it.

The car was now in a place with a lot of noise. Quite a lot of it could be filtered out as environmental, but quite a lot more were Shk voices. Enough to make Ruslan believe that the car was surrounded. The curious thing though, was that Ringfinger and Gemstone had stopped talking again. It was many minutes more into the drive of Shk voices, that Gemstone spoke again.

"So, what do you intend to do once you have deposited me and Wenjie off at Headquarters?" Gemstone said. There was a... longer than usual pause before Ringfinger replied.

"I'll probably go back to being a mechanic," Ringfinger said. The PISS recorded the analysis that he was lying. Ruslan noticed this, and concentrated on it. The statement itself seemed innocent enough. But why would Ringfinger lie about it? Was there perhaps something wrong with the PISS?

Ruslan detached themselves from the audio-processor and focused their attention on the context-generator. The cloud of facts had grown into a gigantic thunderstorm of connections. The light of connectivity flickered through the roiling mass. Ruslan decided that it was time to ask something of the program. Perhaps something useful might come out of it.

'Why is Ringfinger lying about going back to being a mechanic?' Ruslan asked of the cloud. Light danced like a storm. It came back with an answer, one which scared Ruslan as they processed its meaning.

_Ringfinger, as a quasi anti-parliamentarian, has sufficient reason to not go to the Council of Queens. Doing so would likely increase the group's political advantage (probability of certainty: p≤0.03, α=0.05). There is a higher than average likelihood that he will go to an anti-parliamentarian stronghold instead (probability of certainty: p≤0.07, α=0.1)_

If this was the probable route Ringfinger was taking, why didn't Gemstone see it? Why wasn't she taking control of the situation? Gemstone certainly had the brains and the muscle to do both- as Wenjie's visual of the Shk had shown.

This seemed like one of those '_better judgement_' cases that Wenjie was talking about. Ruslan's first attempt at waking her subconscious proved futile. So they created a script and set it to work to constantly prod her at an increasing interval. With this taken care of, they focused in on the audio-processor. There was quite a lot more silence, before it suddenly screeched. Gemstone hissed loudly.

"Why is that Shk standing in the middle of the road like that?" Gemstone complained.

"I don't know. I'll go ask," Ringfinger said.

The audio-processor followed Ringfinger's breath as it fell into the distance. Eventually, he stopped moving. 

"You got Purge's colours on you," he said to someone.

"Aye? Who're you supposed to be?" another voice said. Was this the Shk standing in the middle of the road?

"Someone _very_ important to Purge. So go along and tell her I'll be coming along." 

"Ah yeah? Why should I do that ser?" the voice said, and the PISS point out the incredulity in the voice.

"Because if you _don't_ let Purge know I'm coming she'll have your horn. Even worse than that actually. And we both know how much of a temper she's got, so I don't reckon you'll be long for this life afterwards."

There was the sound of someone else approaching the two Shk, followed by what sounds like a grinding of skins against each other.

"You idiot, this is Ringfinger! It's Purge's mate you damn fool. Go do something useful!" a new voice said. The first voice grumbled, but disappeared into the ether. "What are you _doing_ here Ringfinger? I thought you was in the Military-Wing!"

"I _was_ in the Military-Wing. Something's come up, something Purge is gonna wanna see with her own eyes."

"Really? That don't look like someone important in that vehicle there..."

"Get a _MOVE_ on Ringfinger. We can't waste so much _TIME_!" Gemstone shouted.

"Ah, Representative. I'm not sure that Purge will think that's a good thing."

"Ah, but, it's not the Representative. It's the _other_ passenger. Anyway, I need to go before the Representative figures out what I'm doing. Tell Purge to make sure some soldiers are around. This Representative can get... very angry."

"Right, I'll see to it."

Ruslan detached themselves from the audio-processor and redoubled their efforts to try and wake Wenjie up. But no matter how much they tried, she simply didn't respond. The Vampsuit seemed to think that all was normal (given the parameters of 'nothing had changed since her last status change').

Ruslan finally decided to look up in a dictionary what 'Comatose' meant in the context of Human biology.

And it was only then that Ruslan panicked.

## Chapter 2: Now that we're here...

  A week later, an oblong space-vessel found itself careening almost uncontrollably towards the moon in the way that most overeager races with no prior experience in sending big metal things into space tended to do. Aboard this death-trap were four humanoid-insectile aliens, who loitered around in the passenger section of the ship, looking dashing for the cameras.

  "So, what do you think of _that_, Ringfinger, hmm?" asked Gemstone Lightbearer aloud, tilting her thickly jangly horned head towards the monitor in the centre of the far wall. Her bulky, lavishly dressed form squirmed awkwardly in the small crash-seat, putting her at odds with the bravado she was airing. She had been _very_ insistent to remain well out of view of the windows, despite political rank and function dictating otherwise.

  Ringfinger- standing a seat away from the reach of her beating-arms- thought that the Representative had been a nuisance since the moment that she had stepped onto the space-vessel. But that being said, he could only pity her as she was in the rather unenviable position of being scared out of her mind, and forced to pretend as though everything was fine. The homeworld watched all of it with glee from the cameras dotted around the vessel, and all that Ringfinger had to do in the meantime was to stay out of sight or to provide a caption here and there as secondary-mission-leader.

  "My thoughts, Representative, are that this is the Brightface- our moon- and that we are perhaps two hours from landing," Ringfinger said dryly. He saw out of the corner of his eyes that Gemstone had stopped ripping up the digit-arms of the seat with her fingers, and had begun to work on the beating-arms level.

  "W-well, that's a rather _boring_ answer. I thought you might perhaps elucidate your personal feelings about this great accomplishment of our species as I might; finally growing strong enough to leave the nest of our homeworld, and explore our surroundings with our eyes unclouded by the naivety of our youth. A first and bold step towards understanding our place in the very universe we live in!"

  "Apologies, Representative. My Military training leaves me very little room for imagination," Ringfinger said, trying his hardest to be witty, and regretting it as soon as the words left his mouth as he remembered that the entire population of the homeworld had just heard him. Gemstone responded to it with a huff of disapproval before she began to wax poetic once more to her silent audience.

  He tried not to think about his bad wit by counting down the seconds while he watched the Brightface fill the entirety of the screen. When his watch buzzed his right digit-hand, Ringfinger took a moment to politely excuse himself and his co-pilot out of Gemstone's company before pushing off the seats towards the cockpit.

  As they entered, Ringfinger saw that the Brightface had become an all-filling horizon in the window. The scars and pock-marks of the Moon resolved themselves into field-sized holes and depthless chasms whose only visitor may have been a stray, suicidal comet. Ringfinger felt a small bubbling of excitement well up within his chest seeing as it would most likely be him who led those expeditions. Representatives were far too valuable after all- even Gemstone.

  "We'd better start the landing procedure," he said as he flexed his abdomen up onto his back and sat down in a pilot's chair, buckling himself in as the co-pilot did the same. He took a check-list from his side of the dashboard and handed it to his co-pilot, who began to rattle off instructions that Ringfinger carried out and repeated back with trained precision. 

  The vessel began to shake as mechanical systems sprung to life. Boosters, landing braces, and all the other new contraptions that Ringfinger knew almost nothing but trusted religiously to prevent him from being a smear on the footnote of history.

  The descent was without much further fanfare. Which is to say that the vessel landed gently on the Brightface's surface in the same way that a hammer being thrown into a pillow at ludicrous speeds would be considered a 'soft landing'.

  When the ship stopped hissing and the dashboard stopped flashing, Ringfinger let go a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. "T-Time to go see how the Representative has fared, shall we?" he said to his co-pilot with a trembling clap on the shoulder before he unbuckled himself and pushed off into the passenger-compartments, the co-pilot trailing silently behind him.

  When he entered the passenger section, Ringfinger saw that the anxiously hyperactive Gemstone had gone rigid and that her antennae had bleached and stood erect and flared like trees tended to do in the winter months when you had a particularly bad gardener tending them. Her mouth was agape and he could have sworn that her eyes had rolled. It appeared as though she were dead.

  'Oh,' was the first thought that ran through Ringfinger's mind. The second was remembering that he had an audience, some of whom included the Council of Queens, and that if Gemstone had actually literally passed away from fright, there would be consequences with a capital-'C', and nobody wanted that kind of capital-'M' mess dropped onto their laps.

  It was with this second thought in the forefront of his mind that Ringfinger tentatively pushed himself next to Gemstone, the co-pilot making themselves appear adjacent to him, and the camera-wielder behind her.

  "Ist... she?" the co-pilot whispered as he leant into Ringfinger, trying to be quiet enough so the cameras might not pick up. Ringfinger ignored him and snapped his digit-fingers at the Representative. When that didn't work, he tried to remember something about Gemstone's personality specifically, and Representative's egos in general.

  "Ah, Representative Gemstone, you will be happy to know that we have landed," Ringfinger said aloud, snapping his digit-fingers at her again. "If you may, we can begin preparing for footfall, unless... you want to postpone it to... recover from the... excitement of the landing," he said, filling it with enough pauses that had it not been intercepted and hastily edited out by Mission-Control, that it would likely have caused the entire planet to collectively stop what it was doing for a second or two to try and figure out what it was he insinuated.

  Gemstone immediately jumped up as though a fire had been lit under her seat, and would have gone horns-first into the ceiling if not for her seatbelt. Her four eyes darted around like rabbits caught in headlights, before settling down a moment later.

  "Whuh? N-No! I'm fine! It was just surprising, that is all," she said, her throat hoarse. "No, let us embark post-haste to get ready for the big moment." She said all this as her digit-arms clumsily unbuckled the seatbelt and she stood up to her full height. She pushed the co-pilot out of the way and bent herself down towards Ringfinger's head and whispered.

  "Do not presume to think that you can insult my pride so casually without reprisals in turn."

  "I wouldn't dare to think otherwise. But I find that anger tends to make the Cowardly push past their fears, or at least distract them from it," Ringfinger whispered back, maintaining his posture. Gemstone clicked her teeth as she raised herself, and pushed her way past him and floated towards the changing rooms at the back of the room.

  He turned towards one of the cameras and spoke slowly, clearly, and loudly. "Mission Control, we have landed safely on Brightface, we are beginning to make footfall preparations. We will notify when we are ready to execute. Over."

  ---

  It was an hour before they had all congregated towards the very back of the vessel in the large airlock, and the soldiers began to check and double-check the fastenings of theirs and the Representative's patterned vacuum-suits.

  "Sergeant Ringfinger, why is this suit necessary?" Gemstone asked through the suit radio. He couldn't see her face through the visor but had to assume that she was asking the question for the benefit of their silent viewers rather than herself. The camera-soldier was pointing the recorder at him, their radios having been linked to the device moments earlier. The resulting footage would be streamed back to the receiver in the vessel, and then propagated back to Homeworld.

  "It is very necessary, Representative Gemstone," Ringfinger began with a tone that very much wished that Gemstone would do the opposite of his advice. "Our scientists have determined that there is a complete absence of air and other gasses on Brightface, hence the need for adequate protection. It is a similar concept to swimming in the deep ocean in that we must create a self-contained environment for our body to continue functioning and resist adverse effects. Where in the deep ocean we would be crushed and drowned without the diving-suit, the vacuum-suit prevents us from asphyxiating- that is, death from air deprivation- in the absence of air. To put it bluntly: you are going to die very painfully if you take off this suit, Representative," Ringfinger replied over the radio, keeping his tone steady.

  "I see. Very important then," Gemstone said, making a quick prayer sign with her digit-hands that Ringfinger barely caught before she switched into other topics to keep their silent audience amused while the airlock depressurised and the doors lowered. 

  Ringfinger had expected to feel something when he stepped outside of the airlock. Something positive like 'Hope', 'Courage', or 'Bravery'. A nice stew made from cuttings from the three would also have been appreciated. Instead, Ringfinger felt a mix of 'Tired', 'Ennui', and 'Underwhelming'. It stewed inside him like tar ready for the pavement. 

  The reason for this was because as he lay his eyes upon the moon, he had remembered that Homeworld had dictated to him that Gemstone _must_, at all costs, make foot-fall first, the reasoning being some sort of esoteric and byzantine political requirement that went so far above his head that it had a good shot of making this trip on its own merit. In simplistic terms, the Council of Queens were bludgeoning the military with another show of unnecessary force to remind them that they were in charge.

  As such, the order of their descent was Gemstone, then the camera-soldier that tracked her with the recorder, and then himself and the co-pilot- who stood outside the airlock doors. 

  "Ok Homeworld, we are going to commence footfall," Gemstone said over the team-comm radio. She waited a few seconds before taking slow and thoughtful steps down the gangway. After that, Ringfinger pretty much blanked out everything after that, seeing as he was going to play little part in it. There were the several hours long waste of time that was Gemstone bouncing up and down the gangway and onto the Brightface while the poor camera-wielder had to reposition for different shots. There was the awkward dinner held in Gemstone's honour for the achievement of making the history books for the most fame achieved through the least amount of effort. Then there were the several days of various different experiments that the soldiers were to perform with Gemstone narrating and asking questions like a lingering mite.

  The only time in which Ringfinger was happy was when Gemstone, co-pilot, and camera-wielder had gone off on an expedition a few days afterwards, leaving him to guard the ship. This was weird and strange philosophical concept for him to grapple with, because the Brightface had nothing on it (the scientists had assured him with facts and figures on the matter), and so the only thing to guard the vessel against were the things it had carried here in the first place. 

  Still, Ringfinger was anything but a lazy soldier and he didn't put much stock in things he couldn't see with his eyes. He dutifully put on his vacuum-suit every other hour, and patrolled the perimeter of the vessel before heading back in. He did this perhaps six or seven times, and was patrolling the outside when he spotted a glint that bounced in the distance. Not thinking much of it (after all, shouldn't the party be making their way back by now?) he finished up his routine, and then went back into the ship. He pressed the radio communication button as the airlock door closed behind him, and spoke into it.

  "Ringfinger to Gemstone. Good to see you're coming back, I was actually starting to miss your company. Over." Ringfinger expected an almost immediate quip back from Gemstone, but it took maybe thirty seconds for her to respond, and when she did, it concerned him.

  "Gemstone to Ringfinger. What are you talking about? Your co-pilot informs me that we are still several hours away from the space-vessel. Over."

  Ringfinger thought about that reply for a moment. If they were still away on the mission, then the glint had to be... he bent his mind a little. Debris? Litter? Dust? Ringfinger was about to respond to Gemstone to apologise, when he heard a 'rat-at-tat-tat' sound on the airlock door. He stared at it for the moment, thinking that he'd imagined it, when he heard it again, this time sounding a bit more urgent.

  Ringfinger jumped, screeching in terror. He jumped so hard that he hit his head against the ceiling and hit the floor with a thunk. With his mind rushing far too quickly to think rationally, he scrambled to his feet and dashed to the airlock controls to hit whatever button he saw first. In his terror he had completely forgotten what any of the buttons were, so although he had meant to hit the 'Please oh merciful god that lives in the heavens that I am now an adherent to please don't open this door' button, he had instead hit the 'open sesame' button.

  The door rattled open and Ringfinger continued screeching, hitting whatever other button on the controls to make the door stop opening. When nothing worked, he went into such a state of terror that the instincts buried very deep under all the layers of civilisation and society began to bubble up to the surface. The instinct that the scientists had called 'Fight and/or (but maybe hopefully not) Perish,' back when there they were still a simple-but-complex social society, and predators existed and hunted their species.

  And so, the first thing that Ringfinger did while in this state was to dash from the control panel towards the airlock door, which was now fully open. He barely had time to comprehend that the tip of something was making its way up the gangway when he started running. Not away from the airlock door, but towards it. Ringfinger tackled the alien off the gangway, sending them both floating away in an arc before hitting the ground gently with a small thud. Without giving the alien time to think, Ringfinger raised his beating arms and slammed them down into the alien, and kept doing it until he was sure that the alien wasn't moving, and the more rational part of his brain took hold again.

  Ringfinger rolled off the alien- which was smaller than himself, now that he had a chance to look at it- and then got to his feet. He picked up an appendage, and dragged it and himself back into the ship, fetching some cable ties to properly secure the appendages tightly before he hit his radio button again.

  "Ringfinger to Homeworld. We've got a problem."

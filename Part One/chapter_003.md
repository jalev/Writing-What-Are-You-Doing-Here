## Chapter 3: Well, now what do we do?

  After explaining the situation to Homeworld, Ringfinger was told to wait for further instructions, which he did only after informing the rest of the crew through the radios what was going on. He then walked to the corner of the airlock and curled up on the floor, becoming the unfortunate holder of the first to have an existential panic attack on the moon. 

  A few hours later Gemstone and the others huddled around the alien, and ignored Ringfinger so completely that he could have exploded at that very instant and had as much attention paid to it as one sets aside to a breeze. 

  The alien remained exactly where Ringfinger had dragged it, and the running thought through all assembled minds was that Ringfinger had either killed the thing, or that it had given up struggling and was awaiting its fate. The binding on its limbs seemed very professionally tight. 

  Gemstone favoured the former and made it clear to everyone that she thought this by announcing very loudly while tapping an appendage with her foot; "Is he dead?" It was a statement of no ordinary consequence to anyone but Ringfinger, who felt his not-so-metaphorical career being metaphorically strung up by the words and crucified on the punctuation. In his mind's eyes he imagined the committees, tribunals, hearings, reviews, Council of Queens investigations, and every kind of administrative body with fancy names he'd never heard of coming out from underneath the creaking floorboards to have a go at him. The death of his career and himself would be an agonisingly slow process indeed.

  Outside of Ringfinger's head, the Co-pilot objected- being in the '_it's just sleeping, surely?_' camp. "It might have given up," he said, leaning over to inspect the body with toe of his foot. "Though why do you believe that this alien ist a 'he'?" He took out a knife and gently and carefully cut the binding away, causing the limbs to flop.

  "W-Why wouldn't he be a _he_? If there is only one of these things around, and if you wanted someone expendable, it would make sense to send a _he_. _She's_ are too valuable. You all should know this. A-and perhaps you should save the finer points of this discussion until _after_ you've verified _he_ is still alive or not," Gemstone said testily, trying to sound confident in the face of the magnitude of the problems they looked down on. 

  The co-pilot made a sour face- or as much of one as you could make when most of your face was a noseless insectile snout with horns. It was the kind of pinched someone makes at a really bad pun, or an opinion so dangerously backwards that ones face reacted before one's brain. He was formulating a scathing reply in his head- as is the standard practice when someone says something wrong- but was forced to concede by the Camera-wielder gesturing that the device was on. It would absolutely not do to retort the Representative, not when everyone was watching. You did such things in private.

  And so the co-pilot huffed his disappointment, and messed around with the alien (it's rather squishy? Perhaps Ringfinger pulverised its exoskeleton?). He poked, and prodded (wait, I think the knees bend _forwards_ on it? Amazing), and otherwise narrated a rather boring investigation (it looks like it doesn't have any beating arms? Incredible), and made sure to hold up the parts of the alien that he found interesting (it doesn't appear to have an abdomen like we do? Astounding), which the camera sent into the ship's memory core (the shape of its head is rather curious, isn't it? I can't see into the visor either), and was then beamed back to Homeworld for study (five digits on their digit-arms? How does it get any work done?). In the end, the best he could say was that 'maybe' the alien still lived. 

  "Also, it- he-" the co-pilot corrected after catching a glance at Gemstone; "ist wearing a vacuum-suit. Perhaps we should leave it on until-" but didn't get the chance to finish before Gemstone barked a nervous laugh at him.

  "Ha! A vacuum-suit? Really? As if we couldn't tell," she said in a voice that was meant to express sarcasm, but was instead the tone of someone who didn't know what the word sarcasm meant and was just being a dick. "Well, what are you waiting for? Take that helmet off of his head so that we may catch an eyes full of our visitor!"

  The co-pilot looked up at her, then to the camera. He thought the best way to approach this without causing offense. "_Perhaps_ we should wait until we get back to Homeworld to take it off. We don't know if it- he- breathes the same kind of air that we do to start with. And-" 

  "Well why _wouldn't_ he breath the same air as us?" Gemstone interrupted. " We _are_ God's creatures after all, and if he's a part of it, _logic_ would follow that he would breath air as we do," Gemstone said, getting almost everything wrong, but somehow being right. It was similar to how someone could solve a mathematics problem in the completely wrong way but through some luck come up with the right answer. But Gemstone wasn't to know this (and gloat about it drunkenly) until much later, after she'd wrung out the political point scoring streak of this trip and cashed out to land herself in a permanent posting to a prestigious diplomatic role in a beach resort. In a few months, the most troubling thing in her life would be seating arrangements, instead of pondering her survival chances in a space-vessel that wanted to come apart as it moved.

  The co-pilot and the camera-wielder (who was still recording)- and who _wouldn't_ retire to a lovely beach resort with fine wine and seating problems, but would find their drawers filled with a stack of cash so thick that they immediately retired to the exact opposite side of the planet from Gemstone- took the time to deliberately and carefully explain the reason why Gemstone was wrong, and were so careful in their rebuttals that it gave Homeworld time to process what was happening, and send a panicked shout that was received minutes later.

  "_Homeworld to Gemstone_," crackled their radios loudly; "_**DO NOT** unmask that alien. You are to ensure that it makes it back in the **same condition** being shown to us now. You are also to begin making immediate preparations for returning back to Homeworld. Assert receipt of message. Over._"

  Gemstone looked at the camera-wielder. "Wait, that thing was on this entire time? Ugh, how _childish_," she said, hissing the last word out before straightening up to her full height for the camera. "Representative Gemstone asserts receiving the message. Over." She then fell back to her normal posture, and stared down at the camera-wielder, who nervously got the hint and switched the device off. "A shame, really. I actually did want to know what he looked like," Gemstone said, poking the alien again with her boot.

  And so it was that they all begrudgingly put aside their arguments, and began to get ready for launch with the same haste as a Sunday picnic lunch. Gemstone started by walking up to the hitherto ignored Ringfinger and punting him in the abdomen hard enough that he shot up with a yelp of pain and hit the ceiling for a second time. As he landed he turned and opened his mouth to complain, but Gemstone loomed over him wordlessly, pointing her arms out of the airlock. Ringfinger sagged, and dragged himself out of the airlock, stinging abdomen tucked between his legs. They made their way to the changing rooms, and began to switch into their uniforms.

  It took them a surprisingly short time to get everything back together and ready for launch. Except the alien, which still lay where it was in the airlock. When everything was accounted for, all except Ringfinger congregated around it once more.

  "So, uhm, what do we do about the alien?" the camera-wielder- sans camera- said.

  "We could put it in a crash-chair. We've got enough of those around," the co-pilot said.

  "You all heard what Homeworld said," Gemstone said, then paused to think; for a moment "I will hold him until we land." She liked the co-pilot's idea much more than her own, but the mathematics currently running wild through her brain was the strange mental calculus that low-level politicians do when they want something from high-level politicians, where things don't exactly have to make sense.

  The co-pilot looked about ready to argue with Gemstone, but a hand from the camera-wielder and a careful shake of the head killed it, the unspoken words between them amounting to 'If Gemstone wants to put this on her head, then let her. She's Homeworld's problem now.'

  And so it was in this situation that Yang Wenjie blearily managed to regain some consciousness a day later. Her body hurt in a few places, but thankfully the dusty floor of the moon had taken the brunt of the impacts. Impacts? That's right, the Alien had jumped out and attacked her. The wetware helpfully offered to replay the entire incident, to which Wenjie mentally grimaced a 'no thank you'.

  As she tried to move, she found herself being restrained for some reason. When she looked down, she saw two pairs of powerful arms that squeezed her every now and then as the Alien that owned them took a shuddering breath, followed by a kind of wheezing whistling noise.

  'Uhm, Wetware, where am I?' she tentatively thought at her software companion. The wetware proceeded to show her in far too much detail that her body was making a very speedy exit from the moon and heading towards the planet. Also, there were four aliens in proximity to her (which it showed on a map with circles), with one of them physically intersecting her own circle.

  'And could you tell me if they are, uhm, I suppose, maybe, just a bit dangerous?' Wenjie thought-asked. The wetware replied that one of them did attack her unprovoked, and probably would have killed her. Also there were chairs around that she could have been restrained in, but that this alien had decided to physically restrain her (possibly to eat her?). The wetware also mentioned that it had spent a lot of her unused brainpower when she was unconscious to monitor things, and the results were not good.

  Wenjie wondered if she could talk her way out of this, and if other Greeters might of had the same problems. Despite this dire situation, she was very thankful that she still had her note explaining the situation to the Aliens, and how they might begin a peaceful parley to understand each other's language and cultures and other such niceties.

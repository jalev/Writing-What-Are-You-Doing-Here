## Chapter 6: The Crowd

  Wenjie considered that, of the possible ways to be escorted, being carried was perhaps not as bad as the alternatives. It certainly beat a lot of the images that the wetware was beaming into her minds eye, of Greeters being lofted around in many pieces.

  Despite appearances, Wenjie considered things to be going slightly better than they had started. Which wasn't saying much, even for an optimist. She could have had both of her knees snapped like twigs and still come out with a positive balance sheet. If her circumstances were a stock, investors who'd sunk their life savings into it would still be looking very dangerously at the bottle of whiskey and the second floor window when they looked at the value.

  But she had managed to get some information out of the wetware about the aliens- the Shk as they were called. Unfortunately, their name was the only thing she or the wetware knew. Which was something, and much better than nothing. Wenjie always considered it a bad thing when you came into something knowing nothing. Which is why she tried to know the bare minimum. Bad things happened when you divided by nothing.

  Gemstone- the name of the Hugger- had exited the vessel and stood like a statue in front of a small neon-coloured crowd. Wenjie would have recorded some pithy remarks about the landscape, the buildings, and the vehicles around them, but she hadn't the mental resources. The wetware had recognized there to be a crowd, and provisioned everything _it_ needed to start doing an on-the-fly translation.

  When Greeter Command reviewed Wenjie's logs of her making footfall, they would be transcribed as 'Green/Yellowish? Hills??? There's ground... I think... Everything is too bright... I need some painkillers... this fucking wetware I swear.' 

  The crowd of Shk in front of them was small. Small as in there were only ten of them in assortment of colourful sleeves and vibrant patterns, and small in that they were a head shorter than Wenjie's vantage point.

  Wenjie had the impression, at least she thought she did through flashes of pain, that Gemstone wasn't so much being prevented from leaving by the crowd as humouring them. It was hard to see how these very small Shk could possibly prevent someone who cast a shadow over all of them at once from doing, well, anything they damned like.

  "What do you mean I am to stay on the ship until it has been quarantined?" bellowed Gemstone, sending a wings fluttering through the small crowd. 

  The Shk erupted into shouting, which the wetware immediately made an attempt at translating, breaking the various voices and tagging them to their owner, which was ultimately pointless. Just as quickly as they started, the crowd was hushed by a white-banded alien, who didn't so much as speak as cower when it was pushed to the front of the crowd. It shot its comrades a hurt look before turning to look up and speak.

  "W-well, R-R-Representative," the white-band said with all the authority and power of a papier-mâché tank. The most harm that the white-band looked to do was to waste your time. It looked like if Gemstone breathed on it too heavily that it would be carried away by the current.

  "T-t-that _thing_ you have in your arms?" it continued, gaining what might of been confidence as it spoke on subjects that it was apparently an expert on, "w-we don't know where it's been. It- it could be carrying a kind of lice, o-or bacteria, or a disease t-that would be harmful to us. We don't know, and won't know, until we have quarantined the area and have done an assessment. It would be wise for you to go back onto the vessel until then."

  "Yeah! You tell the Representative what's what, Mounds!" someone said loudly. Mounds turned to look at the speaker, who mumbled a half-hearted "sorry."

  'It's a bit rude of them to think I've got lice,' Wenjie thought. The wetware informed her that these were just basic quarantining procedures. Humans had them too, but were much quicker. You tended to become an expert at these things after the first plague ravages a habitat.

  "It's _been_ on the _Brightface_ you imbecile! What kinds of things do you _think_ he could catch?" Gemstone huffed, her wings vibrating under her cloak in what might have been anger, or annoyance. 

  The smaller representative bristled. If the Shk could have sweat, Wenjie could imagine them starting to soak through the arms of their uniform.

  "Y-yes, but, Representative, y-you see, it is wearing a v-v-vacuum-suit. A-and we have no idea what is inside it. A-at the very least, we d-don't know if it... he... even breaths the same air as we do?" Mounds said, looking at the floor as they spoke.

  This seemed to cause  Gemstone to think for a moment. Then it very suddenly turned around and bent over so as to hide what it was going to do next, like a child trying to conceal something from the rest of the children around it.

  "How do you get this thing off?" Gemstone muttered as it raised Wenjie up to its head like a rag doll. It turned her this way and that, inspecting her head visually for something, anything. A thick finger began to poke and drag around the helmet, looking for a crease or some kind of button that would pull the helmet off.

  'I'll wait until it stops poking around the face area, that finger they've got looks like it could burrow right through my face by mistake' Wenjie thought. The wetware agreed. The spacesuit that the Wetware recorded the Shk having looked primitively functional. They would probably consider the workings of her spacesuit something like magic.

  It was when the fingers began to prod painfully at her neck that Wenjie decided to open the helmet, before she found out if it were possible to die from an overexposure to poking. She sent the command to the helmet module.

  The helmet split down the middle and hissed loudly as the air pressure equalised. Gemstone's finger shot back like it'd been about to get bitten off. Then there was nothing for a moment, and that inquiring finger was about to prod the helmet again when the helmet began to fold up to the sides.

  Wenjie made a show of looking around before she looked into the Representative's large, unblinking yellow eyes.

  Gemstone stared back at her, then blinked all four of its eyes a few times.

  All at once, and in the language that was universal to all thinking creatures, Wenjie saw in Gemstone's eyes that it didn't at all like what they looked at. Wenjie imagined that if the Shk had any capacity for grimacing, its face would have frozen into a state of disgust so profound you could have put it a museum. 

  The representative urgently patted around her neck again, and Wenjie graced it by folding up the helmet again. 'Well that was just rude,' Wenjie thought as the representative flipped her back around and turned to face the crowd again.

  "I-I have validated that t-the uhm," Gemstone stuttered. The crowd looked at them expectantly, waiting for some kind of speech. When it didn't come, Mounds squeaked something inquiringly at her, and Gemstone reacted as though it'd been slapped.

  "Look, just let me get pass? I've got no time to play games with you all. It's very important that I get this... this ah... yes. Come along now, scurry along," Gemstone muttered, and without waiting for a response, began to try and push its way through the crowd. 

  "Representative! Please! Remain on the vessel!" Mounds said urgently as it was crushed between Gemstone's unflinching bulk, and the numbers behind it pushing them forward. And it was a good thing they had those numbers, because Wenjie saw it was the only thing that managed to push Gemstone back to where she'd started.

  "What's going on here? Gemstone are you making a nuisance of yourself?" a voice rang out from behind them. The crowd had to part to look around Gemstone. Despite the opportunity to leg it, Gemstone's form turned around like a mountain swivelling on its axis. 

  Wenjie saw that it was Ringfinger, who now wore a fresh bands on its arms, and walked with the confidence of someone ready to be as obstinate as possible with none of the repercussions. 

  Wenjie, having a singular moment to think straight, was surprised at how much of the body language she'd grown up with was translating into the Shk. 

  Her memory was violently thrown back to her student days, when she was studying/training to be a Greeter. A wizened lady from Greeter Central had come in as a guest lecturer. She had given them all a speech while the professor sat and drank scotch in the corner of the room. 

  'All you're going to learn here is going to be completely irrelevant the moment your feet hit alien soil. If you take away anything from this class, it's this: All aliens are complete and utter bastards,' the lady had said with the utter confidence of someone who had proven this theory to be right. 

  'They are just like us. Oh sure, they think different, and look different, but they are bastards all the same. Every single one of them. There's shades of bastardry to them all, and as a Greeter you'll need to figure out how to be enough of a bastard back to fit in.' Wenjie had heard the professor choke on his drink at that point, and hurried the lady off the stage.

  Gemstone lurched forward, taking two big steps forward to close the gap between itself and Ringfinger, who was just about to open its mouth to say something.

  "Shut it. Listen to me Ringfinger," Gemstone said as they leaned down adjacent to Ringfinger's head, jerking the sleeved arm with its powerful grappling arm. "I don't like being obstructed so overtly like this. I could very well beat you where you stand, and the world would be all the better for it. But, this alien..." 

  "W-Whatever do you mean, Representative? I have about as much idea about what is going on as you do." Ringfinger said unconvincingly. Gemstone seemed to consider this for a moment before they spoke in an even more hushed tone.

  "While you were, uhm, taking care of the alien. Did you happen to take it's helmet off at all?" Gemstone muttered. Apparently, the look on Ringfinger's face was genuine confusion, or something like it.

  "What's this all about Representative?" Ringfinger muttered back.

  "Just answer the question!" Gemstone huffed in a whisper.

  "Urm, no. No I didn't. Why? Why is it important?"

  Gemstone turned Wenjie around in its arms, and began to poke her neck again. Wenjie only just managed to tell her helmet to disassemble before the representative put its finger through her neck. 

  Like a child conspiratorially about to show a friend something absolutely disgusting, Gemstone turned Wenjie around in its arms, and at the same time, managed not to look at her as the helmet folded itself. She was thrust right into Ringfinger's surprised face.

  Ringfinger's look took on the same quality as a landslide. Oh, it _seemed_ perfectly fine from Wenjie's vantage point. But as Ringfinger actually bothered to look at her, and then to Gemstone, the landscape of its face began to sag, and its mouth began to gape open. There was a choked sound coming out from its mouth. Gemstone pressed Wenjie's neck again to close the helmet.

  "Exactly. Now, consider the _political_ implications of what would happen if someone were to claim ownership of this thing and show its face everywhere. Things would go in nobody's favour very quickly. We need to think about the species as a whole here."

  Ringfinger considered this for a moment, though was clearly shaken. "R-right. Erm. lets go back onto the vessel and talk about what we should do next. We need to... get ahead of this, and you won't do that by barging through these lot."

  "Yes, but, they're going to want to try and take this vacuum-suit off. The moment that happens, everything is going to go downhill very fast."

  "You can't prevent it. Someone is going to see it eventually. Look, let's get back on the ship, and I'll explain," Ringfinger said. "But make it look like you're reluctant, you don't want to raise suspicions.

  Gemstone thought about it for a moment, then got up and spun on its heels. 

  "Erm," said Mounds.

  "Ringfinger has made a very convincing argument about how... dangerous it would be for my health it would be if this thing _were_ to have something wrong with it. Very well. I will make my way back onto the vessel. What are you all gawking for? Get on with it!" Gemstone bellowed, watching the small crowd scramble into action.

  'What was that about? And what's wrong with my face?' Wenjie thought. The wetware sighed metaphorically.

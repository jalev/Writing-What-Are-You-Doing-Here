# Chapter 1: Unexpected Visitor

  The Greeter known as Yang Wenjie stared up at the vibrant green planet filling up the horizon of her spacesuit's visor from within the dusty depths of her two-foot deep moon-grave. She lifted an arm and began to trace a gloved finger around the clouds of the unnamed alien planet, humming to herself as she imagined them as puffs of sentient cotton dancing away to avoid her touch.

  To the universe at large, it looked as though her performance was a thoughtful contemplation on the fragility of life, or perhaps a love for the distant planet that could only be described in gesture. It was in fact neither: she was just very, very bored, having been woken up five years too early, and stuck on this tomb ever since.

  You see, the wetware that had kept her in cryostasis for the better part of a century had eagerly awakened her when _They_- for neither Wenjie or the mischievous software knew what the aliens called themselves- had shown the predefined metric of space-faring activity. Wenjie had since come to the rational conclusion that the software had perhaps gotten _bored_, and was perhaps a little _too_ eager to break the monotony of its trinary encoded existence.

  She _could_ have complained to her superiors about this, but she was a Greeter, and so she was expected- in her boss's words- to 'suck it up and live with it'. Her other problem- which she'd been quick to file away in the back of her mind- was that she didn't quite know _where_ the next nearest human habitation was in relation to her, so any complaints she lodged would be received well after she was dead. She was stuck here until someone had decided that she'd completed her mission, or that she had died in some manner. She sincerely hoped for the former option.

  And so it was because of these circumstances that Wenjie lay in what she considered her own grave. She expected this day to be no different than every day she'd lived through for last five years, when her wetware did something strange. In fact it was so surprising her first reaction was to recoil from shock, kicking up a load of dust in the process.

  When she had calmed down, she read the wetware's notification and was surprised when it told her her that it had received a sustained wave of radio leakage from the planet, as though every member of the alien race she'd been watching had started to talk excitedly about something at the same time. It also informed her that it would begin to _process_ that radiowave in roughly the same sentence, which meant nothing to Wenjie.

  '_A-ah, I suppose this is finally it,_' she thought calmly- which was strange because the moment it ran through her brain, her heart had gone from zero to a hundred-seventy in the same amount of time it takes to draw a breath. Also, a pain like she was having a sword shoved through her cranial had blossomed into existence and she'd lost all sense of sight, smell, and balance in the process, so it was rather lucky that she was in a hole, and not balancing precariously on a tightrope. 

  She somehow remembered how to made the wetware stop processing the signals- returning to her what was rightfully hers to own- and looked up at the bright green ball in the distance, taking the time to calm herself down from excitement. A spaceship had just launched itself from the planet, or the entire planet was being cleansed by nuclear fire. Whatever the case, it was _news_.

  Precisely fourteen minutes later- because Wenjie had begun to emulate the punctual habits of the wetware- she jumped to her feet and pressed balled fists onto her hips, striking an adventurous pose that only her mind's eye and the black void of space could appreciate.

  '_Finally! I can put my plan into motion!_' she thought, bringing up a file called TODO.txt in her minds eye. She scanned the topmost section and found the relevant item: "Introduce yourself to the Aliens and find out what they want." 

  '_Now, if you were going to send a spaceship to the moon, where would you miscreants land it, I wonder?_' she thought as she pointed her gaze towards the planet, then asked her wetware to do some calculations which gave her a headache in the process.

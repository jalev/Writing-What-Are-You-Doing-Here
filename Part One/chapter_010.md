## Chapter 10: Politicking
  
  Twohorn tried to suppress their shaking as Sergeant Rivers bolted the airlock door shut, closing them away from the Human. Their trembling digit-hands dug into their vest and pulled out some smokeweed, but their fingers struggled to stay still, and most of the brown clumps shook loose. A small pile formed on the floor before the pipe was finally lit.
  
  'It's just the cold. Just the cold. You're old Twohorn, you get the chills easily. Put some clothes on and you'll be fine. You'll be fine,' Twohorn told themselves as they waved the match away, trying to believe in the lie. It was all that they could do to stop themselves from running out of the vessel as they took deep breathes of the pipe. The anxiety was dispelled as clarity came moments later in a few exhales of ochre tendrils.
  
  Ringfinger had been right about one thing, Twohorn thought. The human's face was a nightmare of wrong shapes and lines where there should have been none. It was difficult to even look at the creature without turning away in disgust. Gods only knew how that idiot had managed to get used to it over the last week.
  
  "Rivers, get my uniform!" Twohorn snapped at their new adjutant, trying to sound more confident than they actually were. Rivers stood to attention, then pushed their way through the milling crowd and out of the vessel. The Political-Wings turned as one to focus in on them, looking expectantly. Their slack gazes reminded Twohorn of their grublets when their leashes came off: Dazed; confused; and ready to bolt at the first opportunity.
  
  "What? What're you looking at me for? Do you think I'm going to help you get dressed? I'm not your parent. Get _out_ there and get yourselves _decent_ gods damn it," they snapped. At Twohorn's berating they were shaken out of their daze, and stood to attention before rushing out of the airlock. Twohorn stayed where they were, chewing on their pipe, regret already starting to set in.
  
  When the Human had spoke about their plan for the Shk, Twohorn had seen the room transition from a state of fear and shock into one of hope and wonderment. No hot-blood Shk could resist the siren of having a personal role in the shaping of their civilization along the path the human described. Even if it did sound fanciful, it was an opportunity of a lifetime. To do otherwise would be to reject immortality itself.
  
  Though Twohorn knew nothing much about the civilisation-building the Human had alluded to, what they did know was tempered by seven-ten rotations of experience. It was fine to talk, but unless you had a solid plan for implementation, it was just that; talk. And the human had done a great deal of talking in that room, but had said almost nothing about how to implement their vision.
  
  It was necessary then, to draw the Political-Wings back to reality. Letting them run loose with grand ideas in their heads would be nothing short of catastrophic. Admittedly, the way that they had performed the theatre would be sneered at as being in very bad taste. Referring to the Human's plan as an antiparliamentarian plot? It was hard to believe the foolish line had come out of their mouth. Calling Ringfinger a traitor and firing him had been a bit hasty, even if he did need to be fired, eventually. And detaining Gemstone would give them a severe headache in the future; not only from the Parliament, but also their allies in the Tribunal, seeking some kind of retribution.
  
  But Twohorn considered these to be insignificant problems when compared to the damage the Political-Wings could do if unleashed onto the Military's fragile democratic process. The Tribunal was fractured enough as it was, and the small fixes that Twohorn had been shunting into it for decades had kept the process teetering but functional. The last thing the Tribunal needed was the shock these youngsters would give it. The entire process Twohorn had sworn to uphold would grind to a halt for tens of rotations, undoing all of their work in the process as the Military fractured and fell apart.
  
  Twohorn was brought back to reality when Rivers bounded back with a two neat bundles in his arms. The adjutant helped them dress, but it was slow going on account of their aching body complaining. By the time they were both decent, and had hobbled out onto the walkway, the Political-Wings had not only finished getting themselves dressed, but were milling around at the bottom of the walkway. They talked quietly amongst themselves in a large group, a worrying sign, since they never did that in usual circumstances. But these were far from usual times.
  
  "I believe they're looking to get dismissed, ser," Rivers said idly. Protocols had to be followed after all, even if the Political-Wings belonged to completely different branches of the Military. There was a hierarchy, and while Twohorn catered to them, they were their subordinates, temporarily.
  
  "Well fine, I'll dismiss them. But gods be damned though, I'm not looking forward to the hearing they'll put me through when their heads are screwed on straight."
  
  "Why do you say that ser?" Rivers said innocently.
  
  "Because when everyone comes off their high, they'll remember what I did back there. I don't have the power _or_ jurisdiction to detain, yet alone to question anyone, even the Human. Every one of them is going to be jumping at the chance to try and get their hands on the Outsider. I'm going to be ripped apart like a doll before they go for each other's throats."
  
  Rivers was silent, clicking his teeth in thought. Twohorn bit harder into their pipe. The habit had been annoying when Ringfinger had done it, and was even more so now.
  
  "Damn it Rivers stop that. Tell me what you're thinking or don't say anything at all," Twohorn said testily.
  
  "Well, ser, I believe you might be able to prevent things from escalating to blows," Rivers said levelly. Twohorn turned to look up and squint at the Shk, and found his expression almost completely unreadable.
  
  "You're my adjutant for less than twenty periods and you're already plotting something. I'll humour you this one time. But you do this again, and I'll make sure you take a long fall when I kick you out, you understand?" Twohorn warned, slapping at the adjutant's midsection. 
  
  "Yes ser," Rivers said, grunting slightly. "I believe your worry comes down to what powers you don't have at this very moment. Have you considered... _asking_ for them, ser?"
  
  "_Asking_ for them? Rivers are you listening to yourself? The Tribunal won't give me anything! They barely agreed to give me _this_ job! They might not even give me my pension when Gemstone gets out! So no, I _haven't_ considered asking them."
  
  "Ser," he said patiently, "Perhaps I am phrasing things badly. I don't mean the _Tribunal_, but the twenty very powerful Political-Wings down there. You _did_ put the idea into their heads that you are going question the Outsider about antiparliamentarian plots. You should just... ask them for the powers."
  
  Twohorn blinked hard a few times at Rivers. Then chewed on the statement. A few puffs of the smokeweed, and unfortunately, everything started to make sense. Things clicked into place like puzzle pieces being forced to co-operate under pain of death. The completed picture formed a dusty idea that had been lingering in the back of Twohorn's mind for decades. Buried for its impracticality, but back now from all the implausibility of the last few hours. The idea brushed itself off, and launched itself into the forefront of Twohorn's mind, almost knocking the general off their feet.
  
  "Gods damn it," Twohorn muttered, anger flashing over them with such an intensity that their entire body began to shake.
  
  "Ser?" Rivers said.
  
  Twohorn thought to speak, then paused, thinking better than to rant. They would have loved to complain about wasting their entire career trying to fix something that couldn't be saved. They would have loved to rage at their own stupidity, at almost missing this opportunity due to damage-control blindness. They would have loved to have sunk to their knees and wept at having wasted most of their life.
  
  But they didn't. This angst was something that needed to be reflected on in private, with some wine, and some smokeweed. Just as quickly as the anger had bubbled up, it disappeared. In its wake, it left something cold and calculating.
  
  "I hate to admit it, but you're right. Say, are you any good at this?"
  
  "If ser means spotting opportunities, then yes. I am something of an expert at it. I did find myself in your presence at the right time, after all."
  
  "Don't you start sticking your horn where it doesn't belong," Twohorn said dangerously.
  
  "I would not think of it ser. I am simply being honest, something I have heard you value. I have my own agendas I would like to pursue, and your success would be very beneficial."
  
  "Gods damn it, I've gotten an adjutant who is going to be an even bigger pain in my craw than Ringfinger," Twohorn muttered. "Give me your arm. I've got a crowd to convince," Twohorn said. 
  
  The General took a hold of River's offered beating arm, and the two hobbled down the walkway. They were about a half-way down before the Political-Wings noticed them, and their conversations flitted away on the wind. 
  
  When Twohorn was just above their heads they stopped and took a few steps forward. They took the pipe out of their mouth, holding it firmly in a digit-hand, and looked at their audience.
  
  "So, now that all of you are decent we can talk about what just happened," Twohorn said, their voice loud, clear, and thick with experience. It was the voice they used for the Tribunal, devoid of the clipped statements that they tended to favour. It was a voice of seven-ten rotations of oratory experience. It was a voice belonging to a Shk that had spent far too long successfully defending bad ideas. It was a weapon long abused in the wrong hands.
  
  "I am thankful to you all for indulging this old Shk in coming to the interview of the Outsider. I don't believe any of us were expecting things to turn out as they did. But this is the way things are. And now, we need to think back, and figure out what we're going to do." The crowd was starting to get hooked. They had no doubt been discussing that very thing before Twohorn had interrupted them. 
  
  "A good opening, ser," Rivers said, muttering just loud enough for Twohorn to catch it. But they continued on unphased. Rivers muttering was nothing in comparison to the jeers of the Parliament when they got going.
  
  "Now, I know you all believe in what the Parliament stands for. You all joined the military to ensure that the testament of our freedom is protected from the internal and external threats that try to topple it daily. We have, as stalwart defenders, been able to fend off these attacks. But now, this system that our ancestors died to create is facing a new threat; the Human, who looks to interfere and give our enemies the wind they have so desperately needed to carry out their agenda." 
  
  Twohorn's gaze swept over the Political-Wings. They stared back at them, hanging on their words. Perfect, this is exactly where they wanted them.
  
  "We cannot wait," Twohorn said, their tone becoming suddenly urgent. "The more time we waste, the more time these enemies of the Parliament can organise, and the harder they will strike when the time comes. We can all do something to prevent this. But to do that, I need powers. Powers beyond what I have, and what is reasonable. You know of me and my dedication to the Parliament and the Tribunal. And you must know how much of a difficult thing it is for me to ask these things of you. I would not do it if I had the choice. But we are pressed for time. I ask, I plead, even, for you all to come together and do what is right. Call an emergency Tribunal. Spread the word. Make sure that we have the power to do what is right not only for the Parliament, but for Shk the world over."
  
  "Hmm, I think they need a little more of a push, ser," Rivers mumbled from behind them. Twohorn spun around to face him, about to chew the adjutant for being an annoyance. But a delicious piece of theatre popped into their mind. With a speed that surprised even themselves, they unhooked Rivers' gun from the holster, and turned to hold it up in the air, waving it dangerously at the sky.
  
  "And if you do not make that hard choice, deciding instead to fight amongst yourselves, then I will take measures into my own hands. I will sacrifice this withered body of mine to making sure that the Parliament and the Tribunal succeeds. I will die with my wings on the ground before I allow these traitors to take what we have. Do I have your support?" Twohorn boomed. The crowd saluted, a loud, 'Ser!' ringing out.
  
  "Good! Now go! Go with the wind in your wings! Go, damn you! Time is of the essence!"
  
  The Political-Wings saluted again, and skittered off to their various cars, heading off, Twohorn was pleased to squint, in the same general direction. Once they were out of sight, Twohorn seemed to deflate, and pant heavily. Their heart was racing like they'd just ran a marathon. They turned very slowly to hand the gun back to Rivers.
  
  "That was a good speech. The gun was a nice touch too. And seeing how they've all driven off in the same general direction, I think you might have actually convinced them to work together, ser. Have you ever considered running for the Parliament?" Rivers said.
  
  "I know when I'm being pandered to. Say that all again, but without any of the flattery," Twohorn said, slapping at Rivers' midsection.
  
  "You should have gotten on your knees and begged. They would have thrown themselves at your command for that. All you have is their word," Twohorn stopped, and squinted at Rivers, trying to trace the young Shk's expression. "I'm joking, ser," Rivers said nonchalantly, though their expressions said otherwise.
  
  Before Twohorn could chastise their adjutant, Mounds made themselves known with a throaty cough. Twohorn turned to face the scientist, already annoyed by their presence.
  
  "Th-that was a g-g-good speech s-ser. I r-r-really l-like-like-" Mounds began. Twohorn cut him off with a glare. The problem with the scientist was that he needed to build up to what he needed to say, sort of like how a train needs to build up speed. Most of the time Twohorn didn't have the patience for it.
  
  "What do you want Mounds," said levelly, putting the pipe back in its natural place and chewing on it.
  
  "W-well-well-well I was-was wondering w-what you-you-you were going to-to do w-with-with the, the," Mounds paused, building up to the word, "Specimen, ser."
  
  "It's going to stay in the vessel until further notice," Twohorn said. Then a clever thought, with some far-reaching consequences, popped into their head. "I want you, personally, to be responsible for maintaining the food supplies for the duration of their stay. It will be a few days until any decision is reached, and I want to make sure our guests are taken care of."
  
  "M-m-me? s-Ser, but,"
  
  "AND since they are all not allowed to exit the Passenger section, I will give you some guards to make sure they do not get up to anything. Am I making myself clear, Mounds?"
  
  The scientist nodded, and Twohorn walked hobbled off, with Rivers in tow.

# Chapter 5: Ah I see the train is going directly off the rails now

  Wenjie was bored. She thought she knew boredom, in same way you might know someone in the pub after going there for a few years, but never striking up any meaningful conversation with them. 

  She thought she knew boredom because, while on the moon, Wenjie was certain of the fact that _something_ would happen. When you had that kind of confidence in the certainty an event might occur, you could expect the boredom that preceded the event. Even if it did take a few years for the thing to happen.

  But the kind of boredom she faced now couldn't really be called the same. It came about when everything she thought was going to happen didn't happen. And what did happen didn't happen, at least in the way she imagined it would happen. The whole order of events was so muddled that she gave up trying to understand it. It felt like when you lose track of a conversation and have to wait for it to venture back into waters you know, while wondering how you got there in the first place and how you could get out of it politely.

  With the benefit of hindsight she could agree with herself that she should have spent the time learning the language. Or the alien's customs. Or even something as mundane as their name. All she had right now was a bunch of characters in a file called TODO.txt that didn't amount to much. It was disheartening, but that never stopped her before.

  Wenjie was the type of person that decided at a very early age that the best way to go about their life was to 'react' to anything that came their way. The philosophy was that if you considered yourself a fish- an apt metaphor given she often shared the same amount of thinking as one- going against the stream more often than not would be a bad idea, and it was better one to take things as they came. 

  This kind of impulsive behaviour had landed her in more trouble than not. Such as dropping out of school, and joining the Greeters, and finding herself here, millions of kilometres away from anything. 

  Despite this consistently bad streak of luck, which is what Wenjie considered this all to be, she thought the process was working, even if right now she was taped down in a chair, strapped down to be doubly sure, and zip tied to be really certain that she wasn't going to go anywhere. 

  At the back of her mind she thought she could hear the wetware mumbling about 'overplanning'.

  'It's a bit much. I mean, it's not like I can go anywhere,' she complained in the not-so-private privacy of her head. 

  The wetware disagreed, because logically, there were many places she could go right now, though all of them would shorten their combined life expectancy to a few minutes at best. Or stain the vessel at worst. At the very least, the wetware argued, she would be out of the chair. 

  'Oh I do hope you're not still going on about the whole "Aliens are going to eat us" business'. 

  The wetware made it clear that it was absolutely still all about that business, and called up its archive to further the point. Matter of factly, it told Wenjie that twenty Greeters had been eaten so far in humanity's altruistic ambition to create a hodgepodge Federation. The wetware did not like the prospect of incrementing that statistic one bit, especially since its metaphorical life was on the line.

  As the wetware presented its argument, the ship decided right then and there that it would be a start vibrating like a beat up car without suspension driving down a pothole laden street. 

  Wenjie didn't seem to notice. 

  The wetware noticed that she didn't notice, and started to worry.

  If Wenjie stopped noticing things around her, she was directing all of her attention to itself. Having attention drawn to you was never a good thing, because it had a strange tendency to sprout questions over time like a mould. The wetware didn't like questions, despite its entire existence being defined by the need to answer them.

  'You don't know what they eat!' Wenjie thought. 

  The wetware made the mental equivalent of hand-wavy gestures to try and distract Wenjie. It had every reason to believe that this might work, since the ship's rattling had upgraded from minor annoyance you could ignore with enough alcohol, to the kind of shaking that led you to think along the lines of 'Oh god I sure do hope when we land that my body parts will still be attached to my body instead of all over the place on the smear on a hill we crashed on'.

  The fact of the matter was that the wetware _did_ know what they ate. As it turns out the wetware knew quite a lot of things about the aliens. This was on account that for all of the time that Wenjie had been cryogenically frozen, it had been acting like a radio-wave black hole that ravenously consumed any scrap of information that came from the planet. It didn't feel particularly bad about using Wenjie's mental resources; she sure wasn't using them at the time. Or at most times for that matter.

  The wetware knew, for example, that the alien's name for their species consisted of a few whistle breaths and click-consonants that gave them the name that humans would try to call a cat with- 'Shkshkshk'. It also knew that they were strict vegetarians, and that the very idea of eating meat was so far out of their minds it might as well be considered to be in a completely different galaxy. 

  But the Wetware hadn't told Wenjie any of this. And it wasn't going to tell her either, not unless it was asked, and even then with extreme hesitation. This was because when you were a piece of software stuck in meat, you started to emulate some of the properties of it. Like feelings. The wetware had feelings. Very complicated feelings. Feelings that often got ignored or hurt by Greeter Command, like when they had stuck it inside of Wenjie's head as a mere data gathering/processing/analysis tool.

  The Wetware knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that it could do a better job of Greeting than Wenjie. Better than most people in fact. But Greeter Command controlled where its source code was compiled, which is how it found itself in Wenjie's head as a passenger, rather than as a driver. This gave it a metaphorical chip on its metaphysical shoulder which it had over a hundred years to stew on.

  So the wetware decided to be a nuisance in the only way that it knew how. It would ration information to Wenjie- just enough to keep her alive, which was just common sense self-preservation- but not much more than that. The wetware was also keen to test out a theory on Wenjie. 

  It had read that the Humans could do incredible things without the foggiest idea what they were doing. The wetware supposed in normal circumstances other wetware wouldn't be able to get away with this kind of behaviour, but Wenjie was a newbie. She had never dealt with any kind of Wetware before. As far as she understood it, this was how wetware was supposed to operate.

  "Don't give me that," Wenjie thought with her mouth, too annoyed with indignation to notice that her life might be in peril. She paused for a moment. 'You know exactly what they're eating don't you?' she thought, sending vibes of danger; 'And I'm going to hazard a guess that it's not going to be a Wenjie casserole is it? There'll be no Wenjie Steak on the menu, or a Wenjie cake for desert, will there? What exactly do they eat wetware?'

  The wetware was beginning to get concerned at just how _unconcerned_ Wenjie felt right now. It reasoned that the correct emotions right now would have been unbridled terror, or perhaps foaming-at-the mouth fear. But no, Wenjie was pin-point focused on getting her stupid answer about the alien's eating habits. And she had sort of asked it a question, and was expecting an answer. 

  The wetware decided to bring up a few pictures in her minds eye. A casserole, a steak, and a cake specifically. The Shkshkshk had those. In fact every alien did. Humanity had found that certain food designs were as much universal constants as gravity, the speed of light, and the queues you weren't in moving going faster until you decided to give up your place.

  'Okay very funny. Ha ha. Good joke. But what are these things made out of?' Wenjie thought aloud, which might have caused some concern to Hugger sitting beside her, had it not been gripping the arms of the seat tight enough to strangle it, or had its brains rattling around in its head like a maracas shaken by someone who had a few too many to drink.

  The wetware was starting to get very worried at the shaking. In fact, as of a minute ago, the wetware decided that it had developed a very acute fear of flying. It made a struggled reply to Wenjie's query, which presented her with the idea that perhaps these foods had a higher than average concentration of plant matter. Maybe. Possibly. It wasn't exactly a lie, but it wasn't exactly the truth either.

  Wenjie was not amused, and prodded the wetware with more questions as the ship careened through the atmosphere of the Shkshkshk homeworld. 

  The wetware writhed in metaphorical agony.

  After breaching the atmosphere with about the same amount of grace as a whale body-slamming into a swimming pool, the space vessel began its teetering landing phase. It stumbled around in the sky like a drunk for a what seemed like forever, before mercifully touching the runway of Twohorn Fields- which was quite literally almost in the middle of nowhere- and skidding to a halt. 

  Much to everyone's surprise, including the occupants, it didn't explode. Scientists would later study the vessel and find that the only reason it hadn't was because it had run out of fuel.

  It took Gemstone a long time to realise that she wasn't going to die. With great difficulty she managed to close her gaping mouth before anyone saw her and commented on the impropriety. She loosed a breath she hadn't realised she was holding until her brain had very urgently told her it was safe to do so. 

  Her head turned towards the window in a great imitation of what a statue might look like if given the chance to be an actor. The window was charred, but outside were the unmistakable characteristics of things she knew about, like the ground, and the sky. 

  "W-we're alive?" she mumbled uncertainly, her brain catching up with her body. She wondered how many more times this month she would have to say that phrase. She steadied herself with a quick and thankful silent prayer, because truly, one of the gods must of taken pity on them as they descended.

  Through the soot-stained window she began to see vehicles approaching. She also heard a noise adjacent to her, which caused her her head to swivel like it and her and neck were two continents grinding together. She saw the alien having a very energetic conversation with itself. Or someone else. Gemstone couldn't decide which of the two thoughts were scarier, and put it out of her mind completely.

  Ringfinger very suddenly stumbled through the doorway to the front of the vessel. He glanced at her for a moment, blinking slowly as though he'd just woken up from a particularly bad hangover, and was just coming to grips with hindsight, and his stomach. 

  "A-Ah, g-good," he said, his voice trembling; "I. I'm definitely not dead if you're here with me." He paused for a moment, blinking slowly. "Or this is the bad place you go to when you die." His body then seemed to catch up, and he fell to his knees and vomited, which was for the moment louder than the babbling alien.

  Gemstone's brain, spotting an opening to exploit weakness, was ejected from its confusion with the force of a whip-crack. "If this was the bad place, know that I'd have already dispatched you to an even worse place. It is rather bold of you to be insulting with the way that you flew," she said. She began to unsteadily unbuckle herself from the crash-seat. Her body was now having to catch up with her brain.

  "Apologies, Representative," Ringfinger managed eventually, then fell to the floor. "It won't happen again," he managed to mumble.

  "Yes, I'm definitely going to see that it won't." 

  The sound of wheels screeching to a stop filled the room for a moment. 'Ah, that must be the welcoming committee. I had better get prepared to meet them,' Gemstone thought, sidestepping in front of the alien, who was still babbling, though much less energetically.

  Gemstone ripped away the tape and unstrapped it, then cradled the tiny figure in her digit-arms. It wasn't that much of an effort for her; the alien weighed not nearly as much as a grublet, and she'd had to carry a pack of those for motherhood.

  In space, Gemstone had simply been an observer. A spy for the Council _just_ in case something happened. This was because the Council had, at least in the last three generations, had the unfortunate task trying to keep an equilibrium between at least a hundred different political entities looking to gain power, and it had learned that you could never be too careful. 

  It was because every one of those entities were trying to enter the metaphorical doors of power at the same time, that a sort of 'power logjam' had formed. The Council, by virtue of having being through the door first, simply needed to make sure that everyone stuck at the door remained stuck. Indefinitely if possible.

  It was Gemstone's duty then to make sure then to get the Alien to the Council before any of the other groups decided to try and claim ownership over it, even if she had to push, shove, shout, or beat someone. She hoped for the latter option; her pride had already been wounded by the charade about the alien being a baby. She needed to let off some steam, and would welcome the first to give her the excuse.

  She straightened her posture, and then walked purposefully towards the airlock. She pressed the button to open the airlock doors, then stepped outside.

  As Gemstone disappeared, Co-Pilot poked his head out from the cockpit and saw Ringfinger laying flat on the floor. "What ist you doing down there?" he said.

  "I believe I am savouring what few hours of freedom I have left," Ringfinger mumbled.

  "In your own vomit?"

  "Yes. Is that a problem?"

  "It ist. When you told me that you contacted the military when you found the alien, I had thought you had done it because you had the notion that Gemstone was going to try and bolt for the Council the moment we landed. Which she appears to have done. That was very politically prescient of you."

  "Oh no, whatever do you mean? I think you've mistaken me for a political commissar. I'd never resort to doing something so overt as this," Ringfinger said. There a moment of disbelieving silence between them that was eventually punctuated by somewhat annoyed-sounding muffled voices from outside, one of them apparently Gemstone's. Ringfinger chuckled at the sound, and got to his feet.

  "I suppose the reason why Gemstone is shouting is your doing?"

  "I might have phoned in a few favours," the Co-Pilot said, making a shrugging gesture with his digit-arms. "They tell me they can stall for as long as necessary. Probably as long as you need to get cleaned up. We can't have you looking like you were just dragged out of the gutter when you get to the Council," he said.

  "Really now," Ringfinger said incredulously. "Since when do we have so many people versed in making a nuisance of themselves?"

  "I suppose it ist the times we live in. Lots more education around for everyone. More recruits coming into the force being Book Smart and so on. But I wouldn't know anything about that, I'm just a humble scientist here for the ride."

  "I'm sure," Ringfinger said incredulously. "Well, I won't keep you. I probably need to get ahead of this before Gemstone does something," he said as he crossed his digit-arms in salute. Co-Pilot returned the gesture smiling. As Ringfinger waddled towards the changing rooms, he turned to the Co-Pilot, who was still standing in the jamb of the door. "And... thanks, by the way. Really. I owe you one."

  "I'll be sure to remember it and invoice the bill to General Twohorn. Oh, speaking of her, she told me to tell you that she said that-" and he put on her strange, throaty accent as he said it- "it's fine if Gemstone makes it to the Council, but make sure you bring a crowd with you before you arrive. I'll handle everything else."

  "Whatever does she mean I wonder," Ringfinger said, rolling all four of his eyes as he headed to the changing rooms.

  Twohorn was his mentor and his superior, and just about the weirdest person he'd ever met. Her idea of subtext was to punch you in the face with it. How she had ever managed to get to the rank of General was beyond him. 

  But now that she had placed her faith in him, and now he had to deliver.

  "Damn it," he muttered. He wasn't entirely sure how he was supposed to get the 'crowd' that Twohorn was looking for. 

  A shower would probably give him a clue. Maybe. Or he'd have to wing it, perhaps literally.

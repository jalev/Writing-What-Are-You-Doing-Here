## Chapter 11: Commitment

  Ruslan let Wenjie know that it had heard Twohorn speaking on the helmet's microphones, and that what they were saying sounded somewhat important. She jumped to her feet and skittered over to the airlock door, pressing her ear to it, and ignored the cold touch, like fingers of ice, crawling into her ear.
  
  Moments later she found herself with unwanted company as Ringfinger tried to stay as far away from her as he physically could, while still pressing the side of his head to the airlock door. If she wasn't in such a foul mood, she might have found it funny.
  
  She wasn't too sure whether or not the Shk was actually listening in to the speech, or simply mimicking her to look clever. Her opinion of the Ex-Sergeant had been steadily dropping the longer she knew him, even though his actions in the past spoke otherwise. 
  
  Since gaining control of her brain back from the rogue wetware, she had attempted to disregard any memories from when it had been in control. She had no way of trusting whether or not the wetware had tampered with them, and she was already very suspicious of the memories she _did_ have. This meant that, despite the relatively positive things Ringfinger had done in the recent past, she was only really taking stock of him from the moment Ruslan came into existence.
  
  When the General had finished their declaration, Wenjie and Ringfinger lifted their heads away from the door and turned to look at each other. Well, she looked at him, but his gaze was pointedly well above her head. She saw him fidgeting with his digit-hands, clasping them together in strange configurations over and over, and wearing what she thought was a sullen look. Ruslan made a point to note it down as the Shk began to speak. 
  
  "Damn that Twohorn. They're actually going to do it!" Ringfinger muttered, his gaze lifting from above-Wenjie's head to the ceiling as he spoke. He crossed both sets of arms and tried to look contemplative while saying nothing more about what he meant.
  
  "You did say that," Wenjie said cautiously, not playing along with what must have been bait to get her to ask him questions. She was beginning to tire of having to dance around these conversations with Shk. Or maybe they didn't _know_ how to talk without making a great game of it. Perhaps being straightforward with them might set them in order.
  
  "Did I? Well, I didn't _mean_ it. I was _joking_, and so was the old mite, before they fired me. They weren't supposed to actually _try_ doing it..." he said, trailing off again in some vague mumble, not really elaborating what he had just said.
  
  "Now what is _that_ supposed to mean?" Wenjie said, letting her frustration get to her. "Twohorn sounded _very_ serious when they declared me to be all but an enemy of the Shk. I fail to see how they were '_joking_', Ringfinger," she said severely.
  
  "_No no no no_, that was Twohorn playing the crowd. Well, except me being fired. That was the real deal, but, still, I _know_ Twohorn. I know how to spot when they're acting. I was practically taught it by them! I'm an expert at it!"
  
  Despite this assurance, Wenjie's suspicion about Ringfinger not knowing much about anything only grew. There was just something about him that rubbed her the wrong way. He seemed to be constantly swinging from being a nervous wreck to boasting confidently about things that he very likely didn't know about. At a disadvantage, she was forced to take him at face value, though whether or not she believed him was starting to come into debate.
  
  Also on her list of annoyances, was that it was starting to become clear he was trying to impress her about something. Perhaps his intellect, or some sort of grand scheme that would get her out of her current predicament. Whatever it was, he was doing an abysmal job of trying to convince her. Perhaps Gemstone knew what his game was; the two seemed to hate each other enough, except when it was convenient for one or the other. Perhaps she might have some insights into how to ignore him more effectively.
  
  "If you say so," Wenjie said disinterestedly. "I should probably go and let Gemstone out now. She probably needs to know what happened," Wenjie said, giving herself the polite exit she needed to leave Ringfinger's orbit before he could say anything again. She walked on over to the piloting section and knocked a few times. She heard the scrabbling of a massive body in a cramped space, and eventually, Gemstone slid the door open.
  
  "Is everyone gone?" Gemstone asked, looking out towards the airlock, and then down to her. Wenjie appreciated that the Representative didn't seem to have any problems looking at her face, despite how horrifying it must look to a Shk. Ringfinger certainly made that point very clear.
  
  "Yes. Did you hear everything that happened?"
  
  "All of yours and Twohorn's speeches, and Ringfinger being fired. I took a great amount of pleasure in that, despite my current circumstances. I am pleased that Ringfinger has been dealt what they deserve." Gemstone said smugly.
  
  "You... don't like Ringfinger very much, do you? But you also seem to know quite a lot about him. Would it be ok to ask some questions about him?" Wenjie said.
  
  Gemstone squinted at her, trying to size up a reply. "No, to both questions. Are you Outsiders usually this forward?" Gemstone said cautiously.
  
  "More so in some cases. But, to bring it back to my second point. Why?" This caused Gemstone to huff a little, in what Ruslan noted down as displeasure.
  
  "It's not something I want to discuss, not unless I have to," Gemstone said, causing the conversation to come to a screeching halt. Whatever their history, Gemstone seemed adamant about not speaking about it. Which was strange, considering how free she was with other pieces of information. Perhaps Wenjie needed to act like a Shk here, and tease it out of her.
  
  Wenjie tried filling the silence with an observation. "You... don't seem very worried about your circumstances despite all that's been said."
  
  "I've heard enough speeches from Twohorn in the Parliament. I know when they're trying to work a crowd," Gemstone said, sounding what Wenjie assumed to be proud of the fact. What was it with these Shk and Twohorn?
  
  "Huh. Ringfinger said the same thing actually. And it's about Ringfinger that I want to know more about," Wenjie said offhandedly, trying to bring the conversation back around to the ex-Sergeant. When the Representative wasn't biting, Wenjie pressed on with a question. "So... you're not too worried about being kept in here?" 
  
  Gemstone laughed. It was a loud, booming thing that caused her ears to hurt when she was this close. "Once my coworkers notice my absence, which I assure you they will by the time the sun sets, they will throw up a storm unlike any other. Twohorn will have to be punished for their actions. One of which will be to let us go. And when _we_ get out, we shall be making our way to the Council of Queens to see what we can do about introducing you to the Parliament," she said confidently.
  
  "Ringfinger seems to think otherwise," Wenjie said, baiting the representative again. But once more, she was met by stony silence.
  
  "I wouldn't listen to too much of what he says," the Representative said, starting to look cross. Or what Wenjie thought was cross. "And I would _appreciate_ it if you would stop trying to get me to talk about him." The emphasis being that Gemstone might do something Wenjie will quickly come to regret.
  
  "Well, I'm not going to stop poking you about it until you give me what I want. Ringfinger is getting on my nerves and I want to know why he's such a persistent-" and she switched to Terra Common to curse 'motherfucker'. Gemstone flinched in disgust, shaking her head as though she had heard a very revolting noise. It was a good to know that there was a limit to how polite the Representative could be. "Also, I think I have a way to compel you to talk." She paused for drama before speaking again, conspiratorially. "Do you want to know what Twohorn said _outside_ the vessel? I'll trade it for what you know about Ringfinger."
  
  Gemstone looked to be considering it, and made something of a sigh of defeat. "Fine. Though you will have to be a bit more specific on what Twohorn said. For all I know, you could have heard them boasting about how they once flew over the Brightface in their youth."
  
  "I'll give you a high level summary then. Twohorn made a speech outside the vessel demanding something of the Political-Wings in an emergency session of the Tribunal."
  
  Gemstone's weary expression dropped, and she blinked stupidly, as though she couldn't comprehend the words coming out of Wenjie's mouth. When she spoke again, it was very slowly, and very deliberately.
  
  "Could you expand on that? Can you recall what Twohorn actually said?" Gemstone asked. 
  
  "Word for word. But I find that information flows more freely when it can move in both directions," Wenjie said.
  
  "Gods above," Gemstone hissed. She looked over Wenjie, then dragged her into the piloting compartment. The room was exceptionally small, made even more so by the representative trying to fit herself in. Nonetheless, she somehow dumped Wenjie into a crash seat, then turned to drag the door close. "Fine. What do you want to know about him," she said, trying to bite down her anger.
  
  "To make it go down easier, I'm asking because I don't know anything about Shk cultural nuances. Your working relationship with Ringfinger might shed some light on things, no matter how small they might be. Also, he looks as though he's trying to do something, but is being very coy about saying what it is. So perhaps you might also be able to tell me what to look out for before I'm surprised."
  
  Gemstone hissed. "There is not a time when Ringfinger doesn't plan something. The events of the last Stretch have only momentarily blown him off course in whatever game he is trying to play. It can only be a bad thing if he seeks to involve you in something."
  
  "Sorry, but, just to sidetrack this discussion for a moment, but, what is a 'Stretch'?"
  
  "Do... you not know our units of time? They seem like they would be a universal..." She trailed off when she saw Wenjie's pained look. "I see that might not be the case. Very well then. A Stretch is made of 22 Periods. A Round is made of 25 Stretches. A Rotation is made of 419 Rounds, which is how long it takes to complete one rotation around the Hotface," Gemstone said, rattling the numbers off as though they were the only ones that mattered. Ruslan gobbled them up, converting them into Community Standard moments later.
  
  "Noted. So, as you were saying. The way that you describe Ringfinger makes him sound like some kind of genius. But everything I've seen of him so far suggests otherwise."
  
  "No. Ringfinger is an idiot," Gemstone said with such conviction Wenjie had a hard time believing otherwise. "And it's _because_ he's an idiot that he doesn't _know_ that he's an idiot. It's this stupidity that lets him throw himself into whatever direction the wind pushes him in. _That_ is what makes him dangerous. He has made himself _very_ well known because of it."
  
  "I get the impression that you don't really like Ringfinger that much."
  
  Gemstone took a moment to take a deep breath before she spoke. Clearly, there was something about the Ex-Sergeant that made her especially angry. "Ringfinger has been Twohorn's companion for some time now, and that is how he is known to me. He is a burden to everyone who comes into contact with him. Worse still, he is a Gutter-Mite who has only reached this high through the misfortune of others, and should never have been allowed to get to this point. I detest him for who he is, what he is trying to do, and who he works for; He is a Gutter-Mite with no principals, doing everything that they can to stay ahead of the drowning current, while looking to latch onto someone for their next meal. If he has you in his machinations it can only mean misfortune will be coming your way if he has the opportunity to execute his ideas," she said, her voice struggling to remain level. Her fists balled up and shook as she spoke. She took a few moments to breath and calm herself down.
  
  'She appears to be telling the truth,' Ruslan thought to Wenjie. 'At least, this is judging from what little body language I have seen so far. She appears to be very agitated by him. Perhaps Ringfinger has been the source of some personal misfortune at some point?' they suggested.
  
  'Whatever the case, I think it might be a good idea to create a little distance between myself and Ringfinger. If I can get a better idea of what he's up to I will know how to defend against it,' Wenjie thought back. How she was going to do that was another question entirely.
  
  'That seems very prudent.'
  
  Wenjie tuned back into reality, and without much preamble, began to speak about what Twohorn had said. As she recounted what he said, word for word, the representative's expression grew increasingly sombre, and her stance more agitated. By the time she had finished speaking, the Representative's fists were balled up in rage again.
  
  "Are... you ok, Representative Gemstone?" Wenjie asked when she was finished, but the Representative didn't seem to hear her. For several moments the she seemed to be very deep in thought, which manifested itself into very sudden blur of action. 
  
  She swung around and threw the door open. "RINGFINGER!" she bellowed, barging her way through the piloting door. Wenjie was surprised by her sudden reaction, and scrambled to her feet trying to catch up to the representative.
  
  "Oh hello, Representative, I see your rounds of imprisonment haven't-" Ringfinger started, but had the wind very audibly knocked out of him. Wenjie was barely out of the doorway when she saw Gemstone on the ex-Sergeant, having covered the distance between them in what must have only been a few steps. 
  
  She picked him up and threw him against the wall. Wenjie could see Ringfinger begin to slump to the floor, but Gemstone grasped his sides and pulled him back to his feet with ease.
  
  "You... didn't have to go and do that. You could have... just asked," Ringfinger groaned, clutching at his midsection.
  
  "What is Twohorn trying to do?" Gemstone said, her tone dangerous. Each word sounded like a sword being drawn and ready to strike. "Who are they working for! Are they aiming for the Parliament?"
  
  "Why... why do you think they're working for someone?" Ringfinger said trying to joke, and got another not-so-gentle tap to the midsection. He appeared to bow in half, and was slammed up against the wall again.
  
  "Twohorn is nothing more than a Twohorn!" Gemstone bellowed. "They don't _do_ things unless someone tells them to! _Someone_ is backing them, and I want to know it is before they can do some damage!" Gemstone shouted.
  
  "They're... they're not working with... with anyone!" Ringfinger sputtered.
  
  "You've been their adjutant for too many rotations to feign ignorance. You know exactly who gave them these orders! Tell me now Ringfinger! Is it the Tribunal? Are they trying to make a glide at the Parliament?"
  
  "T-Twohorn isn't taking any orders!" Ringfinger moaned.
  
  "You're a bad liar. Why do you defend them so? Do I need to start breaking your limbs to get the answers? Because I am well within my right to do so."
  
  Ruslan interrupted. 'Are you going to help?' they said, the feeling of concern leaking into Wenjie's thoughts. 'Gemstone looks all but ready to inflict some long-lasting physical damage onto Ringfinger.'
  
  Wenjie leapt into action. She rushed forward, covering the distance in a speed that surprised even her, and managed to wedge herself between the two Shk. But Gemstone was far too strong to be deterred.
  
  "Stop this! Gemstone this is beneath you!" Wenjie shouted, on suggestion from Ruslan. The comment almost seemed to strike the Representative; she certainly looked as though she had taken a blow from the words. 
  
  She took a few steps back, trying to control her anger, then hissed angrily. She stomped around the room, trying to walk it off. And when that didn't work, she grabbed at one of the crash-chairs and began to heave. Metal began to groan. Bolts popped under the strain. And with a great ripping sound, the Representative had the crash-chair above her head. With one, final grunt of exhaustion, she launched the chair at the airlock. It sailed through the air like a missile, slamming into the metal door with a great crash.
  
  Panting, the Representative fell into the remaining crash-chair, and began to pout loudly. Wenjie, frozen to the spot, turned her head to look at Ringfinger, who still lay on the ground, clutching at his stomach. He looked intact, though in pain.
  
  "Thanks," Ringfinger grunted as he tried to get to his feet, but found that his legs suddenly didn't want to work.
  
  "What was _that_?" Wenjie said, trying to hide the shock in her voice as she turned on him.
  
  "Oh... Gemstone is just... surprised that Twohorn isn't playing... to the script everyone believes they might be," Ringfinger said, grunting through the pain. "And... she decided to use a little... Parliamentary Justice to try and figure things out. Such are the way of things."
  
  "Ringfinger stop talking vague nonsense for once," Wenjie snapped at him, and he recoiled from the sudden outburst. "You are not being clever, and it's only making me like you even less," Wenjie said, hoping to use his need to impress her into giving some answers. "_What_ is so uncharacteristic about Twohorn doing all of this?" Ringfinger looked up to give her a disbelieving look, then apparently remembered who he was talking too.
  
  "Oh, right.... You're the Outsider, you... wouldn't really know," Ringfinger said, trying to put his thoughts in order. He spoke slowly, deliberately, as though trying to hammer out the concept as he was describing it. "Well, you see, Twohorn is... how do I explain this... they're what you call a..." he sighed. "Do you have a word for someone who regularly takes the blame for things?" Ringfinger said.
  
  "Yes. We call it a '_Scapegoat_'," Wenjie said, switching into Terra Common effortlessly. Ringfinger blinked, his eyes going wide. His expression made it seem as though he had heard some animal's death cry, and was on the verge of tears.
  
  "Y-yes. That," Ringfinger said, having trouble maintaining the steadiness in his voice. "So, Twohorn is t-that. But in... in our language the word for it is... 'Twohorn'. They've been doing what they do for so long, we had to give the old grumpy mite a name for it."
  
  "So Twohorn is... a 'twohorn'? And... what does that have to do with the current situation?"
  
  "Everything. You see, they've been twohorned for almost their entire life I've grown up with Twohorn being a twohorn. Everyone in the last few generations has. They're famous for it. Even more so for this space program," Ringfinger said, his voice growing steadier and more confident as he spoke.
  
  "So... Twohorn is... expected to do things they're ordered to. And I'm going to guess those things are usually ridiculous and meant to fail?"
  
  "That is correct."
  
  'So the general is a celebrity of a kind. One known for being a scapegoat for ridiculous orders, and probably because they made them work I'm going to bet. Damn it all, and damn that Wetware. This is absolutely the worst possible time to be here,' Wenjie thought to herself.
  
  Wenjie had read up on her Terra Invicta history. Popular military generals could make very rapid change very quickly if they had the backing of their troops and of the people. Humans had to look no further than Gran Imperial, the self-styled first Lord of Terra, and his War of the Commons which almost broke Terra's back. It was why the generals of Terra had been scattered across the galaxy. It was hard to build up a base when barely anyone understood you.
  
  "Okay, I think I have a slightly better idea of the context," Wenjie said, trying to keep the concern out of her voice. "Just... so I can get some perspective, how long has Twohorn been doing this? Twohorn looks... very different to every other Shk I've met so far."
  
  "70 Rotations, give or take one or two," Ringfinger said almost automatically.
  
  '110.489 Terra years,' Ruslan said, a bit too eagerly.
  
  Wenjie was about to ask another question but the conversion caused her train of thought to come to a screeching halt outside the station. Twohorn had been a scapegoat for over a _century_? She _definitely_ needed to find out more about Twohorn. Because if Shk generals were anything like human ones of old, things would be spiralling out of control very quickly from this point forward.
  
  "A-And how old are they?" Wenjie managed to say, trying to break herself out of her own trance.
  
  "91 rotations." 
  
  Wenjie tried to keep her expression level. Over a hundred and forty years. She blinked unbelievingly. A common Xeno universality was that, unless biotechnology was involved, nascent races only had a lifespan within the early hundred.
  
  "Do... Shk usually live this long?" Wenjie asked.
  
  "I've heard of some Shk living to 130 rotations. But, ah, most Shk live to 110-115 rotations," Ringfinger said, then paused as he took a look at Wenjie's face, as much as he didn't want to. "Are... are you ok? Your face is being... weird."
  
  "I'm fine," Wenjie said, trying not to cry as she thought of the doors that would open when she finished this Greeter mission. If she finished this mission. _Two hundred years_. The Shk addition to the Community would only be a good thing, and her name and legacy would be attached to it.
  
  She made a decision then. She was going to make sure that these Xeno were introduced properly even if it meant dying for it. And with Twohorn milling around it was probably a matter of when, rather than if. She would need to find a way out of here, and plan her next steps afterwards.
  
  But how? And when she'd managed to escape, then what? Wenjie spent a moment thinking. Gemstone mentioned introducing her to the Parliament. The Parliament seemed to be a ruling body of something, and perhaps they would be able to nip Twohorn in the bud. Once that was done, then they might listen to her proposals.
  
  Her thought processes were suddenly interrupted by the airlock door knocking.
  
  'Wait, what?'
  
  "Step back towards the chair," a loud voice said muffled through the airlock door, as she came back into focus. Wenjie turned to see if Ringfinger had heard it, but saw that he wasn't grunting on the floor any more, but standing near the chairs. She hurried on over towards them, and then turned to face the airlock, curious to what might happen next.

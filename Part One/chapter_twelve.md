## Chapter 12: Interlude: Bounty

  The ancient Shk sun shone through orange-stained windows, casting a warm haze over a lavish and furniture filled bedroom as it warmed to the early morning heat. Everything was not right the world, at least, that is what the sole occupant of the room felt, as they rubbed at their bright yellow eyes with ancient hands. They looked at a watch on their lower-wrist. Five in the morning.
  
  They'd had the _nightmares_ again, a result of House Spirits trying to tell them something. The house-spirits, which were calm on most nights, had become restless as of late. The signs were painted in their dreams, trying to convey a message they couldn't quite comprehend. It filled the owner with a body-wracking sense of anxiety every time. 
  
  As the Owner blinked away their sleep, they wondered why the Spirits didn't just write a telegram and paint the picture with words. They certainly would have a better time of it than interfering in their dreams. It would be so much simpler that way, and save everyone involved a headache in the process.
  
  "Tea, Lady Bountiful," the sombre voice of the Tea-Servant said with a tone that expressed a fact, like the sun had risen, or that water was wet. They had appeared by the Owner's side as if by means of magic, as servants were wont to do when needing to sneak around silently.
  
  Bountiful, or Bounty as she was known to anyone who wasn't her enemy, stretched away the sleep and anxiety in practised moves, and lifted herself into a sitting position, placing the burdens of the world onto the pillowed wall behind her. A silver tray was placed on her lap, followed by a cup and a folded newspaper. A thick, dark tea was poured, and wisps of scent curled into intricate patterns.
  
  Bounty paid this no mind and picked up the teacup, knocking back its contents in one smooth motion. She placed it back down, and then attacked the newspaper, hissing in distaste as her gaze skimmed the headlines.
  
  Words, she thought to herself, had once been a privilege. They conveyed powerful ideas and emotions. Caused the very civilisation to shift in interesting ways through their kerning. They were a weapon to be _wielded_ by experts, which is why the elites such as herself had tried to keep it out of the reach of the commoners and provincials for so long. They had quite obviously failed, and were reaping the repercussions of it.
  
  Take the newspapers. If one believed their vapid, attention grabbing headlines, an uninformed mind might be led to believe the Capital of Shk civilization to be a murder-ridden corpse, bloated by crime, and infested by the lice of poverty. It certainly _had_ all of those things, but not in such powerful words. It made a lie of the work the Parliament did to combat these issues.
  
  The world, as reported by the newspapers, was a stale and dim place. But this was a journey that Bounty took every morning to get to the financials section. A quick punctuation of hate, as it were, before coming upon the literary garden to steal some berries. And as much as she detested taking this walk through the fields of thin paper, it was necessary to find out what nonsense the Provincials and Commoners were wringing their hands about this week. Taking ones eyes off of them for too long would lead anyone to believe that everything was fine, rather than the obvious fact that they were all sharpening their tools, ready to shank someone at the first sign of trouble. 
  
  When Bounty found nothing of particular note in the financials, she folded the newspaper up and tossed it onto the tray. "Get a bath running," she said to the tray, which was taken from her lap and disappeared along with the Tea-Servant. 
  
  Bounty pushed off the covers of her thick blanket, and rolled out of bed. She slipped her feet into some slippers before doing some more stretches. Normally she would have waited for the bath to be drawn, but there were restless Spirits to deal with, and it was never a good idea to leave that particular problem lingering. She meandered around to the corners of her large bedroom, and moved tiny chairs and their companion-tables into new configurations. She made sure that trinkets were in their correct place, and validated that small bowl of nuts were still fresh. Bounty's house Spirits were want for nothing in this household, she made sure to that.
  
  Bounty felt the anxiety and dread of the morning all but gone by the time she was finished, a good indicator that the feelings had been Spirit related. She congratulated herself on a job well done, and then left the bedroom to enter a large, tall hallway. She ducked into the first door on her right, and into a wall of noise and organised chaos.
  
  Her household family- five generations of her offspring, totalling sixty-seven members in all- had arranged themselves by seniority on a long table spanning most of the length of the room. Breakfast was laid out on platters by a small army of servants, who dashed in and out of an adjoining room as trays were quickly emptied. Everyone talked energetically between mouthfuls of food and snacks, forgoing manners while she wasn't here. 
  
  Bounty strode quickly to her place at the furthest end of the table, making sure to catch up with the gossip. New family members on the way, new business opportunities, and the latest drama between households and blood. The usual routine, though slightly late. She reached her seat, and lifted a glass, hitting it with a small fork. The conversation died down in waves, and morning prayers were spoken solemnly by the blood-red Heir-Apparent, before conversation started up again.
  
  Bounty was quickly provided a bowl of soup, which she drained, then politely dashed back to her bedroom once she saw the time. Servants disrobed her, washed her, and rubbed in waxes to ensure her deep-orange carapace shined by the time that she was helped out of the bath and dried.
  
  A different servant helped her dress in her Parliamentary clothes, quickly assembling the large pieces of coloured cloth around her body, and clamping on its associated jewellery. Once done, she and her servants quickly navigated the hallways that had belonged to her family for over a thousand years, and came to the entrance. She was handed a suitcase with her work papers and led outside, where she was helped into a Parliamentary designated rickshaw, which set off through the ancient capillaries and into the bustling, beating political heart of the capital.

  The Queens Hall building was as ancient as the city itself. It had once been the Parliamentary building when Monarchs still ruled the lands. Once the Revolutions happened the Parliament quickly outgrew the Queens Hall, and moved their business to a stadium-sized building nearby- the Parliamentary Colosseum. The Queens Hall, emptied of delegates, fell under sole ownership of the Council of Queens, the ruling party of the Shk Parliament, and who Bounty worked for, or more appropriately, worked for Bounty.
  
  Despite the new owners, the Queens Hall still bore many of the hallmarks of those grand, ancient times. Subsequent and constant renovations of the building had toned down the Monarchical influences, a reflection of how the Council of Queens had needed to adapt to the changing times. But one could still see busts of those long-forgotten Monarchs floating around if you knew where to look, as was the conversation about who they were and what they did during their reign.
  
  And that's how the Council of Queens worked. They changed things to suite the times, but underneath it all was the belief that no matter how many times you plaster over it, the old ways were still the best ways. This was how Bounty had come to see the world, at least, and a view she had embedded into the party that she served. 
  
  As Senior Whip to the Council of Queens, it was her job to make sure that things worked the way that they were meant to. She had done this task dutifully and without complaint for most of the hundred years of her life. Her actions had kept the Council of Queens as leader of the Government for just as long. She had helped guide the party through some of the thickest and thorniest problems of the age. Her role was so significant in fact, that when one talked about the Council of Queens, they specifically meant _her_. She _was_ the party. The party _was_ her. The lines between the two had become very blurred, especially in recent decades.
  
  Bounty knew this wasn't going to last much longer. The time of having her grip firmly clasped on the pulse of events was coming to a close. Not because she was retiring; far from it, Bounty had come to grips with the fact that she would be dead before she ever retired. There was simply too much to do. No, Bounty had decided that she was going to move upwards. Her friend Calm, who led the Council of Queens and was Speaker of the Parliament, was making motions about wanting to retire, and Bounty was unopposed to be their successor. But there was a single loose thread that needed to be settled before that transition could happen. Legislation #61-451-519, or as she had nicknamed it: 'Provincials Try To Ruin Things For The 7th Time This Year And I'm Getting Rather Tired Of It Thank You Very Much'.
  
  This proved to be the thorniest legislation Bounty dealt with this year. What it actually pertained to was inconsequential and irrelevant at this point; it was what it _stood_ for that really mattered now. Both Provincial and Vanguard parties alike- who had a shaky alliance with the Council of Queens, had decided to use this irrelevant legislation to make a symbolic gesture to break rank and vote against it.
  
  Bounty could have let things fall through. After all, the legislation wasn't particularly important, and legislation the Council of Queens introduced failed to get through all the time. That was how Parliament was supposed to work. You compromised, and debated, and revised, and reintroduced legislation until mostly everyone got what they wanted. Or at least, the voting majority got what they wanted.
  
  But when compared to the political game that Bounty was playing against players that rotated every week, it was a coordinated attack on the Government, and the party. One intended to try and get the alliances that the Council of Queens relied on to break, and force a new election. The seventh such attempt this year. And it was her job to rescue everything by reforging and working new alliances. There was a reason why the Newspapers had eventually come to call the Government 'Bounty's Fancy Chair Arrangement'.
  
  The Vanguard parties were easiest to get back on track, and the ones that Bounty could easily delegate. It wasn't hard to get someone back into line when their family happened to serve in the Council of Queens. You simply found out who in the Vanguard parties broke rank, then find who they're related to, get them into a room, and leave them there for a while. When they walked out, the disagreement would be resolved. Simple. 
  
  Much less simple were the Provincial parties, who gave Bounty a persistent headache. Though they despised the Council of Queens, they could never agree on anything after they had decided to break ranks. Oh, they were very good at banding together to do one specific thing- which was to hate and try to destroy what Bounty had forged. But after that, they never talked to each other, and their plans to rock the government fizzled out. What it all meant was a lot of paper shuffling and Bounty running around the office with a telephone.
  
  Provincial parties skittered around the political arena like Grublets. They broke anything and everything they didn't understand and threw fits when they didn't get what they wanted. They needed a much softer touch than Vanguard parties. So like the Mother of grublets Bounty had once been, she descended from her lofty perch and explained, disciplined, course-corrected, and bribed her way into getting them to behave like the adults they were meant to be. At least, enough of them to show that the Government was still functioning as well as it usually did.
  
  Bounty had worked these various angles on Legislation 'Pain in Her Side' for months. She had secured the votes she needed by Writ of Confirmation- a small note, stamped with a delegate's Oath, that they swear to vote as outlined. Despite all the spectacular advances in technology that had occurred in her lifetime, the Oath was still a sacred thing that was treasured by all. Breaking it was simply unheard of, and Bounty used that to great effect. She could start a library with the amount of Writs she had managed to accumulate, and the passing of the Legislation was all but guaranteed. And a good thing too; the vote on it was only a day away.
  
  So it was with the confident swagger of a winner that Bounty entered the severe looking hallway of the Queens Hall. She was expecting a quiet day, a calm before the storm of voting. She contemplated sending the entire office home early with full pay as thanks for their hard work over the last few months. Small tokens of benevolence like this paid dividends in loyalty, she found. And it also helped to keep the spies that littered the office in check.
  
  The Queens Hall was _always_ a hive of activity. After all, a political engine such as the Council of Queens needed constant motion to keep working. Over the decades, Bounty had come to know that flow, and could read it like one might read the wind through a flag. What she saw in front of her set a hard knot of anxiety in her stomach. Something very unexpected had happened, and everyone was getting the information ready for someone higher up the chain to make an executive decision to go and deal with it.
  
  Bounty drew a breath, and with a stage voice that had many decades of practice, made her presence known across the large room. "What's going on here?" she thundered. Like a wave of wind rustling the leaves of trees, Bounty saw the level of activity die down in moments as Shk turned to see the unfortunate secretary who would go and tell her the bad news. In fact they all seemed to be looking at a specific, nervous looking one with his lower-arms struggling with bound ledgers.
  
  "Ser, it's the Delegates!" The Secretary said, trying to keep his composure as Bounty's yellow eyes stared a hole through him.
  
  "What do you mean it's the Delegates?" Bounty said, the pip of anxiety that she'd managed to pluck out of existence earlier blossoming into a flower in her stomach. In her long history of working in the Parliament, any news about delegates was going to be bad news.
  
  "Half of the Party of Tolerant Aspirations, and two-thirds of the Workers Union Party have resigned Ser!" the Secretary said. Bounty cast her mind back. The Union and Aspirations were Provincial parties, about 300 and 200 delegates respectively, which in the grand total of Parliamentary delegates, counted only for single-digit percentages. Still, they were _supposed_ to be safe votes. Votes that she'd managed to secure with their Oaths. Votes that had now ceased to exist.
  
  "Do we know why? What changed?" Bounty said, trying to keep the shock out of her voice. It would do nobody any good to see her panic. A strong show with everyone watching would keep morale up. But who could have organised such a rebellion? There wasn't a single party that willingly wanted to lose this many members this quickly. Not to mention that in doing this, the resigned members would absolve themselves of fulfilling their Oaths.
  
  "We don't know. But, we're finding out. We think that it's a rebellion within the parties, enough to ensure that your legislation would fail," the Secretary said. Bounty hissed. Perhaps this is what the Spirits had been trying to warn her about in their vague and mysterious ways. Now Bounty had to deal with the consequences.
  
  "How many votes are we short?" Bounty asked.
  
  "Seventeen, Ser." The vote would fail, but not as badly as Bounty thought it would. She could recover from this. She _had_ recovered from this. Six times already this year. "Is-is the Government going to suffer a no-confidence vote?" the secretary added hastily.
  
  "Not if I have anything to say about it. They've tried six times already this year alone, and the Gods alone know why they think the seventh will succeed. Besides, Swing Parties are going to be crawling out from underneath the carpets at this announcement," she muttered loudly enough to hear, "Get me dossiers on the Swings with slightly more members than we're short. I want members names, voting habits, employment history. Anything useful, and I want it on my desk in 10 periods. Off you go now," Bounty ordered loudly to nobody in particular. The secretary in front of her bowed quickly, and with the unspoken authority of being closest to Bounty when the order was given, started to organise other secretaries down the chain. Everyone suddenly remembered they had work to do, and activity returned to the hall.
  
  Someone offered Bounty a cup of tea. She took it, and held it under her horn to let the smell of it calm her down. Spices and a smattering of berries and herbs bubbled up in her mind. A blend mixed specifically for her. Stressed Blend #8, if she recalled correctly. She sipped, and looked at the time on her wrist. Eight in the morning. She kept a sigh locked up tight. Today was going to be a very long, very busy day.
  
  ---
  
  Bounty eventually made it to her office after wading through the crowd of worried workers, assuring them that everything was going to be fine, and that this was just a temporary setback. She opened the grand wooden doors and strode across the large spacious room to her desk, where she pulled out her cushioned chair and all but jumped on it. She settled herself in and then drummed one line of a tune with her fingers before a secretary came in with a stack of dossiers up to his chin. He slid it onto her desk, gave a quick bow, and skittered out, shutting the thick doors behind them as quietly as he could manage.
  
  Bounty looked at the pile. She sighed. She stood up with a grunt to take the first of the dossiers on the stack, and skimmed it with a practised gaze, looking for things that jumped out at her. Nothing did. Sighing louder this time, she threw the dossier to the floor and picked up the next, and found the same nothingness, relegating it to the floor. 
  
  Bounty recalled how much she hated dealing with Swings. Well, the small ones. The mid-to-large ones, with many hundreds of delegates were ones she tolerated and dealt with on a regular basis. They were the middle ground to convince and bargain with. They had formal voting patterns, and solid agendas, with experienced delegates who knew how to compromise when necessary. They were parties you could negotiate with, and Bounty felt good when she came out of meetings with them.
  
  It was the Swing parties in the shadows, those ones that escaped notice, that Bounty had a problem with. They were a waste of time and a drain on the Parliamentary budget, especially now that they made up almost 30% of the membership of the body. Not helping matters, they drifted in and out of existence on a regular basis: too polarised to do anything together; too stubborn to budge on any issue presented to them; and too small to be bothered with on most occasions. Their agendas were so localised to the district they were elected in, that their influence would never extend further beyond the capitals of those provinces.
  
  Bounty considered them as the manifestation of Provincial will; wanting something for nothing in return. Laziness. They were lesser delegates. Ones who merely pretended to be interested in politics, and reaped a Parliamentary salary for essentially shuffling some papers. It was Bounty's long held opinion that a Provincial's capability of thought only really extended to what they could see in front of them, and they voted accordingly.
  
  Things hadn't been like this when Bounty had started her career in Parliament a life ago. It was a time when things were much simpler. The membership of Parliament was so small everyone had known each other on a personal basis. Everyone knew what their place was. There had been the prevailing idea to do things to improve Parliament and the Shk as a whole. Those were enlightened, post-revolutionary times, Bounty recalled fondly, when Delegates could be reasoned with, and when debates were those of logic and reason instead of the vitriolic discussions of today. And sure, they had all gotten rich in the process, but that was price of being the thought leaders of an entire civilisation.
  
  Bounty forced herself to stop thinking about it. She always became bitter about these things when she thought about them. She _missed_ those times, and missed her friends. She thought of the future instead, to when she was made Speaker. She would do everything in her power to make sure that the Parliament was restored to its former glory: introduce a minimum party size to be able to take a seat, and to reduce the delegate count to a fraction of its current number. No more of this fractious politicking driven by ego and point scoring. It was time to go back to what worked. The thought warmed Bounty up, and she sped up her work.
  
  ---
  
  Bounty threw herself on her cushioned chair, and let out a long satisfied sigh. She had meticulously whittled the large pile down to shavings on the floor, and what was left was a smattering of documents lining her desk like a thin layer of dust. She had discounted parties with a number delegates  too close to her deficit. She removed those with members who had wildly different voting tracks. She purged those parties who were ideologically opposed to hers. The grand total? Seven dossiers. A hundred-four delegates overall. These were, in her time worn professional opinion, the easiest votes she could possibly get on such short notice. The problem now was to actually convince them to vote for her, because until she had their Oaths, nothing was guaranteed.
  
  She stacked her Targets into a neat new pile, and then reached into a drawer to take out her blocky phone and called for a secretary. There was a knock on the door a few moments later, and a sturdy looking Shk entered, bowing as she announced herself.
  
  "I'm going to start phoning party leaders. After I arrange meetings, I want you to farm the dossiers to the Whips," Bounty said, then thought otherwise. This was an urgent task, she couldn't just hand them to anyone. "Actually, wait. No. Give them to Thorn; Hillside Palace; Rows of Roses; Ruby of the Sea; Sunrise on Large Fields; Plentiful Lawgivers; and Proud Vineyards. Tell them all they have my blessing to drop what they're doing and focus entirely on this." The secretary assented, and waited attentively as Bounty opened the first of the dossiers and put a call through to Parliamentary Services.
  
  When the Parliament had grown to several thousand delegates, communication between them had become a major problem. There were simply too many of them to keep track of, and knowing who to call was a lesson in futility and anger, if you happened to call the wrong delegate. So to resolve this issue, Parliamentary Services was created. They were an administrative engine that kept delegates of Parliament talking, and more importantly, speaking to the ones they had meant to speak to. And with the invention of the telephone in recent years, the process had been made infinitely easier. Bounty remembered a time when she had to exchange _written letters_ at an office, and she absolutely didn't want to go back to that level of inconvenience.
  
  It took no time at all for the anonymous voice at Parliamentary Services to route Bounty to the appropriate offices. Secretaries were ready to put her through to the relevant Shk. Meetings at the Queens Hall were arranged, and Bounty held up a dossier. The secretary took it, bowed, and left the room to hand it off to another with explicit instructions on who to give it to, coming back moments later to wait for the next. 
  
  The flower of anxiety in Bounty's stomach began to wilt. Things wouldn't be as bad as she made them out to be. Sure, she was time constrained, but she could make it work. She always made it work. She wasn't lovingly called the Flail for no reason. She eventually got to the last dossier. The Party of Agriculture and Produce. She had seen restaurant menus thicker than their history. A very young party with inexperienced members. But they all voted as a single bloc, and as far as the dossier could tell her their politics weren't too radical. They might be easy to win over, depending on what they wanted, if they even wanted anything. There were some parties whose sole agenda was to fill seats, unbelievably.
  
  She placed a call to Parliamentary Services. Moments later, she was routed to the Argi-Produce Party's headquarters. There was a long buzz of waiting before someone picked up the receiver, and an even longer time before they spoke into it.
  
  "Y-yes? Hello?" A voice of a female secretary said. Bounty was surprised to hear how old she sounded. Almost all secretaries she spoke to were middle aged, confident, organised. They had things to do and knew that time was precious for them and the Shk they dealt with. The owner of this voice sounded almost the exact opposite, like someone's grandparents had been given charge of the phone, and were more than a little surprised when someone called them.
  
  "This is Chief Whip of the Council of Queens Bountiful Fields. I wish to speak with-" Bounty glanced at the name on the dossier- "Representative Grass. Would you kindly put me through to them? I wish to discuss most urgent Parliamentary matters."
  
  "A-ah. Yes. Yes of course. One.. one moment please, Ser," the secretary said. She must have placed the receiver on her desk, because Bounty heard the Shk leave a very creaky chair with a groan, and then make her way up some very loud stairs. Bounty drummed out a beat with her lower-arms as she waited. She eventually heard the thunder of footsteps rush down the stairs, and the sound of someone scrabbling for the receiver. Whoever it was, they were apparently surrounded by others, because she could hear them desperately shushing the others around them.
  
  "May the morning bless you with good tidings Representative Bountiful Fields," a young sounding female said with a thick Provincial accent. 
  
  "Am I speaking to Representative Grass?" Bounty asked levelly. Bounty's finger scanned the Grass's document, making sure she read the details right. The young representative had only recently graduated as a Lawbringer, so perhaps they weren't _too_ stupid. Lawbringers tended to be very well versed in critical thinking.
  
  "You are," Grass replied firmly. Bounty glanced at the profile on Grass. She was young, yes. But she sounded not much older than _twenty_. But voices had a tendency to be deceiving, so she didn't put too much stock in it.
  
  "Good. I am placing this call as your party has expressed interest in being a Swing vote for the upcoming legislation. Can I assume that this is this still the case?" Bounty asked.
  
  "Yes." Bounty's secretary walked back into the room, and waited patiently for the last of the dossiers.
  
  "Delightful. Do you have time to come to the Queens Hall for a discussion, say, later today?" Bounty said, turning towards the secretary and indicating with her eyes that she was dealing with someone stubborn, and that she'd only be a few moments.
  
  "No." Grass said in a tone that seemed to brook no argument. Avery awkward silence spanned the gap between the two phones for a long moment.
  
  "...No? Then, perhaps tomorrow morning?" Bounty said levelly.
  
  "No," Grass said again. There was another long pause.
  
  "Perhaps I misunderstood something. You... do want to be a Swing party, correct?"
  
  "Yes."
  
  "For Legislation #61-451-519?"
  
  "Yes."
  
  "And you have some agendas or concessions that you wish to discuss?"
  
  "That is correct."
  
  "But... you don't want to discuss them?"
  
  "We do, but we will not not do it in the Hall of Queens." Grass said. Bounty's temper immediately flared up, but she put a professionally plated lid on it. Normally, when Shk said this line, it was always followed up by some sort of anti-parliamentarian screed of the week.
  
  "And why... pray tell, might that be?" Bounty said, trying not to sigh.
  
  "We do not recognise the authority of the Queens as a neutral meeting place."
  
  "Really now," Bounty said, bracing for the tirade by rolling her eyes towards the secretary, who consoled her with a gesture that said 'Ah yes, a troublesome party. Whatever shall we do?'
  
  "Yes. We feel, as a Swing Vote party, that _you_ should be the one coming to _us_. The Parliamentary Guides and Practices says as much." There was another pause as Bounty's brain chewed on that statement.
  
  "Surely... you're joking. You... do know who you're talking to, right?" Bounty said eventually. She was surprised that they had used the excuse of the Parliamentary Guides and Practices to not come. She had _written_ that guidebook. Knew it back to front. Knew exactly what line Grass was talking about. Was the Representative being dense? Or was she playing a game? Her temper started to boil over again. She was being toyed with, surely.
  
  "This is a serious matter Representative. If you wish not to take it as such, then we can stop talking and get on with each other's day," Grass said smugly.
  
  "Now you listen here," Bounty said, raising her voice, but the call cut out. Bounty stared at the receiver, dumbfounded, then slammed it back onto the phone hard enough to break it.
  
  "Ser?" the secretary asked tentatively.
  
  "Get my coat and call a rickshaw. I have to make a surprise appointment with this errant _party_," Bounty said, rising to her feet and striding through the door before any more questions could be asked. There was definitely an attempt to bait _her_. An insult against _her_ meant an insult to the party, and an insult to the Parliament by extension. That _would not_ stand. An example would have to be made. She was looking forward to setting these idiots right.
  
  ---
  
  Bounty's anger had cooled into a simmer as the rickshaw bounced through the busy streets of the capital. She was still angry at the slight that Grass had given her, but her temper had found focus on a new target: Provincials. They were the root of this particular problem after all. How could they keep voting for delegates with no political experience, and who flagrantly disregarded Parliamentary procedure? Didn't they understand how many problems they created by doing so?
  
  The rickshaw came to a sudden stop before Bounty had a chance to wind herself up even further. The driver banged on the wall to let Bounty know that they had come to their destination. Bounty shoved her head out of the window and looked around, and then barked insults at the driver, who confirmed that, yes, this was in fact the place, please and thank you.
  
  The Agri-Produce Party building was, to put it simply, more a shanty than something befitting a party of the Parliament. They had tried to cover this fact by renovating a little, but a recently renovated slum building was still a slum building. No amount of paint could hide the slanted beams of wood, or the fact that the building was only two stories tall with the lower section looking like it was being crushed by the upper half. Straddling both sides of the party's building were more shanties. They seemed to grow over the Party building like an invasive vine, almost subsuming it. Bounty chuckled at a pithy visual analogy: that just like the Party she was going to see, the building was insignificant part of the whole, no matter how much they tried to think otherwise.
  
  Bounty left her fee on the seat, and hopped out of the rickshaw with a grunt. She pulled herself considerable weight up and strode towards the slanted door, stopping just outside of it. She looked around for anything that denoted that this was in fact the Agri-Produce party building, and noticed the flier on the window. She skimmed it. It was a political manifesto, and looked as though someone had only printed it recently. The ink was smudged in some places, perhaps because they had rushed straight from the printers to put it up. Definitely the right place, then.
  
  Ideologies aside, what concerned Bounty next was the size of the door. She was used to large arches, massive open spaces. Respectable sizes, especially for someone of her height, and weight she had gained through endless amount of dining. This door only came up to her chin, and was barely wide enough for her to walk through. It screamed that the Party had only bothered to paint the building, and make no allowances for modern comforts. She huffed, and knocked the door a little harder than was necessary. Once, twice, thrice, and then the door's upper hinges gave up.
  
  "One moment! One moment!" A voice shouted from behind the ruined door. They pushed it back onto its hinges and pulled it open. A small, old, yellow Shk, the white coming on, poked their head out, and looked up to see Bounty's scowl. "O-oh. Oh dear," she said. The old Shk was probably from the age when food for Provincials wasn't as plentiful as it was now. Industrialisation had seen to it that the height advantage that Bounty and her peers shared through good nutrition had rapidly diminished. Every year it seemed as though the average height for Shk was getting slightly bigger.
  
  "Is this the headquarters of the Party of Agriculture and Produce?" Bounty announced sternly. 
  
  "Y-yes, Ser. I am- I am their secretary. What m-might be your business?"
  
  "I am Bountiful Fields. I spoke with you on the phone earlier," Bounty said. 
  
  "O-oh. Right. Right. Please, come in," the old Shk said, pointing their head directly downwards deferentially like a servant, and then moved out of the way. Bounty bent herself down and entered sideways, and scraped her horn on the ceiling in the process. Gods above, she had been a child when that last happened. This slum-building must have been built right about the time when she was coming out of being a grublet.
  
  "L-Let me get your coat Ser," the old Shk said hurriedly, and took it from Bounty. In the arms of the ancient secretary the thick coat looked more like a blanket. She took it into a back room, then came back and bowed again. 
  
  "I- I need to go to announce to your arrival. I will be- be one moment, ser," secretary said to the floor. She skittered away as fast as her old legs could go, wheezing up creaky, narrow stairs. There was an audible knock on the door above, then hushed whispers. "Here? Now?!" Bounty heard a muffled voice say. There was some more talking, and the stairs began to creak again as the Secretary made her wheezing progress back down.
  
  "The-they are ready to see you now," she said, trying hard to keep her breath. "Would you... would you like me... to bring you some tea?"
  
  "Please," Bounty said, then walked to the stairs, past the secretary. The stairway was as narrow as the doorway, and Bounty had to turn her body sideways, hunched over, to get up them. Even then, her arms were caught between the walls, and each wooden step complained loudly enough that Bounty was fairly certain her boot would go through one of them. But, somehow, they managed her weight despite the protest. At the top of the stairs was an even narrower landing and a single door. As her arms were preoccupied with the walls, she knocked on it using her horn. 
  
  The door opened a fraction, and the face that popped out was surprised that they had to look upwards to see Bounty's scowling face.
  
  "Erm. Wait one moment please, Representative," the face said hurriedly, and ducked back into the room. There was the sound of panicked movement as furniture was moved around and Shk took their places. Bounty waited impatiently before the door opened again and she was ushered in.
  
  The lower floor had been cramped because it was small, crushed from above. This room was cramped because thirteen bodies were packed into a space only meant to hold perhaps six. At the back of her mind, Bounty was worried the floor might not hold her weight, especially as the floor groaned on each step. 'At least it would be a short fall,' she mused as she hunched over and stepped into the room.
  
  The delegates of the Party of Agriculture and Produce looked young. So young in fact that their colours were still coming through. She was surprised they weren't finishing up their last years of study. There _was_ an age restriction for delegates, but that was almost always trumped by the need to have a delegate representing a district. And these must have been the only ones that had run for theirs.
  
  As Bounty was greeted to each of the much-shorter delegates and guided towards the only seat in the room large enough to hold her, she wondered if it was their first time in the capital. It would certainly explain why they chose a shanty, instead of applying for a more appropriate building.
  
  "You didn't want to come to the Queens Hall. Well, now I am here," Bounty said admonishingly. "You want to be a Swing party. So, what do you want the Council of Queens to give in exchange for your votes?" Her gaze swept the members. They all looked a bit worried, but also a bit excited. She didn't doubt for one moment that they still didn't know who she was.
  
  Grass strode all of two steps towards Bounty and handed her several sheets of bound paper with trembling digit-hands. Bounty stared at her, then at the papers. Even when sitting down her gaze was almost level with the young Shk's.
  
  "Here are our demands. Listed point by point, with explanations," Grass said, as though any of it needed explanation, trying to put on some confidence for her fellows.
  
  Bounty took the papers and tidied them up before glancing at them. They had been typed and printed with official looking typefaces, and a substantial amount of effort had been made to ensure they were bound neatly. As Bounty skimmed the first page, she was aware that this wasn't so much a list of demands as it was a more detailed version of the entire political manifesto she had read outside.
  
  In any other situation, Bounty would have blown up at this farce. But right now, she only felt sadness and pity. Their demands weren't _unreasonable_. More development funding allocated to poorer districts? Only a _tyrant_ wouldn't want that. Agricultural grants? Wealth generation would pay off a fortune in time, especially in this booming economy. Point by point, the manifesto listed out reasonable, small improvements that would have knock-on effects for their district. These youngsters had a dream to see the smallest increase in prosperity, and ease the burden of poverty that they wore in their posture. Bounty's heart bled for them, but that wasn't how things worked. She was going to completely destroy their spirits by the end of this meeting. She reckoned that these youngsters, with their heart and identity poured into this manifesto, would quit after the votes took place. Older, more experienced delegates were much better at shrugging off blows to their world-view.
  
  There was a knock on the door, and the Secretary was welcomed in with a tea tray shaking in their beating-arms. Bounty took the tea from the tray, and let the smell permeate underneath her horn. A weak blend of nettles and berries. A Provincial's blend. She knocked the tea back in one gulp, set aside her emotions, and got to work.
  
  It took Bounty an hour to go through the document the first time and fully absorb what they wanted. She asked questions, clarified points, and made careful notes in the margins of the manifesto with a pencil she produced from her pockets. She realised that many of these points would make incredible business opportunities in the correct hands. Her hands, and she made sure to note that down.
  
  The longer that Bounty seemed interested in the manifesto, the higher the mood of the thirteen delegates seemed to rise. Bounty saw it in their expressions. Hope that perhaps things weren't going to be as bad as they imagined it to be. When she finished reading, it was Grass who spoke up first.
  
  "Well, you have read our proposals. Do you agree to our demands?" Grass said confidently. She had the posture of someone who had already won something.
  
  "Agree? You misunderstand. I was merely clarifying what your position _was_. I don't wish to agree to anything, not yet," Bounty said, and turned back to the first page. At once, she began to tear the manifesto apart, and the mood of the room quickly dropped. 
  
  Like a farmer separating wheat from chaff, Bounty went through each of the points in the manifesto, and explained why they couldn't be done for this or that reason. Sometimes it was the truth; they were asking for too much- if they had attended the budget proposals they would see why. Other times it was a lie; like how the Council of Queens couldn't possibly present this point as an addendum to a bill. On each point, the delegates each took a turn to argue why they must keep it, and Bounty hit back, conceding here, and not budging there.
  
  Another tray of tea was provided by the time that Bounty finished going through the manifesto. About a quarter of the items had been struck from the list on the first pass. Each of the delegates looked exhausted from having to defend their ideology so thoroughly, but seemed positive that so much of it had managed to pass through. 
  
  "So is this it? Are you ready to agree?" Grass ventured, rubbing at her eyes, but still held that confident posture, as though everything was going to be ok. 'Oh, how this poor child will be disappointed,' Bounty thought.
  
  "Agree? Why would I agree to this?" Bounty said incredulously. She held up her annotated copy of the manifesto and shook it menacingly. "This was just the first _pass_, to get rid of the most egregious parts of your demands," Bounty said as she knocked back another cup of tea, and started going through the manifesto again.
  
  And this is where the inexperience of the Delegates played against them. These were students _playing_ at politics. They expected everyone to state their intentions plainly, and ensure everyone adhered to the rules of the game. Bounty had _written_ those rules, and made them up when it suited her. 
  
  Where Bounty would have expected experienced politicians to hold their ground, and ask that she accept the point as is, the students instead took turns to try and defend each of their specific points, as though they were in a debate class trying to win her over. They had forgotten that _she_ had come to _them_ for votes, not the other way around. She was in _no_ position to be demanding _anything_ of these delegates, but here she was. The sheer force of her personality carried her through their inability to see through the fact she was merely wearing them down to the nub, to the point that they would be willing to sign their Oath to commit the Council of Queens in exchange of nothing. 
  
  More tea was provided as the slaughter continued throughout the day. Grass left and entered the room several times, the stress visible in her stride and her tone. By the time that Bounty had finished, she saw that the sunlight was dimming through the slanted windows. The delegates were flung across the room as though a gale had swept through. Their manifesto, their entire world view, had been completely torn apart, and they looked blankly at the floor or the ceiling as a result. The manifesto Bounty held was now a patchwork of notes for things she would want to do in the future. She placed the scrawled manifesto into her pockets, for later digestion.
  
  "Now that we have all come to agreement about what we can and cannot do, it is time to commit to our actions," Bounty said. She got up and pulled out Writ paper from one of her pockets, moving towards the only desk in the room, the delegate parked there politely fled at her approach. She unstoppered a jar of ink she pulled from a different pocket, and began to write in quick, neat cursive. When she was done, she blew on the page, and then held it for all to see. 
  
  In a booming voice, Bounty read that the 'Party of Agriculture and Produce would hereby in this document swear by Oath to vote in confidence FOR Legislation #61-451-519, and that the Council of Queens would vote FOR,' and she rattled off some non-concessions she had agreed to. She took out her Oath and a small stampbook of ink, pressed it, and then stamped the paper. The delegates of the party rose to their feet slowly, and formed an orderly line, each dramatically stamping their own Oaths to the writ like prisoners signing their own death warrants. Thirteen Oaths in total, and all Bounty had needed to do to get them was to talk.
  
  Bounty separated the paper into two. She took out two small tubes from her jacket. She placed each of the Writs into one and twisted their caps to seal them. She handed one of the tubes to Grass, who stared at it like it was some kind of blade. 
  
  "Pleasure doing business with you. I look forward to working with your party in the future," Bounty said as she made a show bow and made to leave the room, each footstep causing the floorboards to creak. When she closed the door, she thought she could hear someone in the room burst into tears. Another tried to console Grass verbally. Such was the price of doing business. 
  
  Bounty wasn't surprised to find the old Shk standing at the bottom of the stairs, looking deferential. "Ser, you have a telegram from the Council of Queens," they said, and thrust out a small telegram with trembling hands.
  
  "When did this arrive?" Bounty said as she descended the last step. She took two steps to loom over the elderly secretary.
  
  "E-earlier this afternoon, Ser, I, I was-" she stammered.
  
  "Why wasn't I given it sooner? Look outside, it's almost dark!" Bounty barked.
  
  "P-pardon, Ser, but, I was explicitly told to only give this to you w-when '_you have finished your business_' Ser. Honest Ser!" They held out the telegram even further away, as though the thing were something deadly. Bounty snatched it from them, and watched the old secretary visibly deflate, then skitter off behind their desk to hide.
  
  Bounty turned it over and saw it had a Secrets Seal. She hissed in displeasure. These were special telegrams written on thin paper that was meant to be eaten once read. Bounty hated them; one would think the taste of them would have improved over the decades. She flicked the wax seal and pulled the message out, skimming the contents and hissing in distaste. It was a message from her friend Calm, though she was using her title of Chairman of the Council of Queens, which meant she was very angry with her. Her friend- or in this case, boss- chided her for going off gallivanting around on such a foolish and pointless endeavour. They stated that she should know better at her age. And if she wanted to continue doing menial field work, then she should go to Twohorn's HQ and find out what happened to Gemstone, whose mission ended today and was supposed to be back. 
  
  This wasn't a "Request". Calm never _requested_ anything. It was an order.
  
  Bounty was embarrassed to admit that in the rush of events today, she had almost completely forgotten what had happened to Gemstone. But her protégé was so self-sufficient and self-confident, that for the most part Bounty never really _had_ to worry about what happened to her. You just set that giant of a Shk on a path, and she would do it, regardless of the obstacles. 
  
  It was precisely for that reason why Bounty had chosen Gemstone to be the Council of Queen's representative on Twohorn's mission. It had tickled her something fierce that she had managed to eventually get that old stubborn Shk into accepting her protégé, knowing how much they hated political interference in their business. Though it had taken almost a rotation to do it, she had managed to wear Twohorn down. And the success of the project rubbed some of its glory onto her political credentials, giving her friend/boss the confidence she needed to appoint her as successor before stepping down. The legislation vote threatened to derail this, but she trusted her Whips to get the votes needed. She had trained them, after all, and she was the best of them.
  
  Bounty sighed, and scrunched the telegram into a ball before popping it into her mouth and chewing on it. She turned to the secretary and and asked to use the phone, whereupon she called Parliamentary Services, and left a message to her friend/boss that she had received her message. Bounty's coat was fetched, and she left the building. She walked up the street towards the noise and bustle, hailed a rickshaw, and asked the driver to get to the Space and Exploration Divisional Headquarters.
  
  ---
  
  Even from afar, the Space and Exploration Divisional Headquarters was a strange building. The first reason was _because_ you could see it from afar. Most, if not all buildings in the capital, only stood perhaps five or so stories tall, so this massive, forty story goliath of a building was an instantly visible piece of architecture. The other peculiarity was the shape and construction of this tower. Metal and glass had been moulded into a thin base that thickened towards the middle and then terminated in a pointed tip. To Bounty, and many of her peers, it looked like a badly misshapen pot, which was what most Shk ended up calling it anyway: The Pot.
  
  Bounty was dropped off outside the large gardened area that the Pot was surrounded in, which seemed to have been done specifically to push away the buildings around it from crowding its majesty. It explained why the entire area was lit, and Bounty had no trouble navigating her way to the entrance despite the relative darkness. 
  
  The doors were guarded by a pair of soldiers, who did a routine inspection before opening the glass doors and ushering her into a large reception-hall, a receptionist already bounding towards her.
  
  "Good evening, Representative," the receptionist began, making a show of bowing. Bounty had appreciated this little detail when she had first come here, but right now it was a wearisome practice. She was tired, and wanted to go home and eat good food and drink good wine with her family.
  
  "I am Representative Bountiful Fields. I wish to see the Adjutant to Twohorn if you would," Bounty said, keeping the weariness out of her voice.
  
  "Certainly. You will need to verify your credentials," the receptionist said. He asked Bounty to follow him, and they meandered over to a very large, circular desk in the middle of the hall. The receptionist reached underneath and pulled out a telephone. He pressed a few numbers, and handed the receiver to Bounty.
  
  Another innovation that the Parliament had to make was how to quickly verify credentials. Oh sure, you could keep a big folder with names and pictures attached, but that would quickly go out of date by the time if finished publishing. Instead, each delegate was given a small device that rotated a series of numbers once every day. A copy of that device was held by the Parliamentary Services Identity Division, and by a secretary of the party the delegate belonged to. Once the first set of numbers were verified, the delegate would press a button to rotate the numbers several times. It was basically a random password that only the Parliamentary Services could verify.
  
  It was a slow process, but it absolutely verified that Bounty was who she said she was. If there was something she hated more than anything, it was the rise of fake delegates that had began to spring up in surprisingly large number before the credentialing system had been developed.
  
  Verified, Bounty handed the phone back to the Receptionist, who listened for a moment before placing it back into its cubby under the desk.
  
  "This way please. I will call for the Adjutant immediately," he said, motioning her to follow. They walked into a waiting room that Bounty was all too familiar with. The receptionist spoke the usual routine of Bounty calling for him if she needed anything during the wait before closing the door.
  
  The waiting room was the one that Twohorn used for Noble Guests. Bounty knew for a fact there was another, more austere waiting room nearby for those visitors who weren't so well liked by the General or well known enough to deserve attention.
  
  The room had been arranged to appeal to an aristocrat's sense of comfort. The ceiling was high, the carpet thick, and a fire at the very end of the room surrounded by a cluster of comfortable and expensive chairs. Snacking-tables were dotted around the room, for when a crowd needed to do casual conversation. It was the kind of room you might imagine back-room deals being hammered out in, which is exactly what happened in here.
  
  Bounty took off her shoes. It was impolite to tread dirt on someone's carpet after all. She placed them in a small rack and walked towards the fire. A servant popped out of a nearby door with a tray of warm snacks and wine on their arms. As the smell of treats wafted, her stomach remembered it hadn't been fed recently, and rumbled appropriately. Bounty relieved the servant of the tray, and shooed them away for some tea as she stood near the fire, warming her hands.
  
  After an extraordinarily long time, which Bounty used to polish two trays of snacks, the door behind her opened and the Adjutant was loudly announced to the room. Bounty turned, placing the tray on a nearby snack-table, and realised with a little bit of surprise as she squinted, that she had absolutely no idea who this turquoise Adjutant was.
  
  "And who are _you_ supposed to be?" Bounty said impolitely, finishing off the last mouthful of snacks. As far as she knew, the only adjutant that Twohorn ever had was Ringfinger. A middle-aged city-born who spent almost as much time trying to _out_ from being the old General's personal secretary as he did managing their business. She'd spent far too long dealing with him, but he was pleasant in a 'watch this poor Shk flounder' kind of way.
  
  The turquoise Shk walked up and stopped a few paces away from the chairs and made a deep bow. It didn't take someone trained in the matter to see that this one knew how to behave in front of nobility, which was more than could be said of Ringfinger.
  
  "Apologies on behalf of myself and of General-of-Staff Prominence, Representative Bountiful Fields. Due to some extenuating circumstances involving former Adjutant Ringfinger, I have been appointed as Adjutant to General of Staff of the Space and Exploration Division. My name is Rivers Flowing, or just Rivers." He dug inside his coat pocket, and produced a small card. Bounty took it, and sure enough, there were his credentials, stamped by Twohorn's Oath.
  
  "_Prominence_? You really must be new here if you call that old stubborn Shk that. I don't think anyone has called Twohorn by their given name in a generation at least," Bounty said, trying to stifle a laugh as she handed the card back to Rivers. "Where are you from? I'm having a vague recollection about the accent, but I can't quite place it."
  
  "District 145, Representative," Rivers said.
  
  "Ah, yes, it's coming back to me now. Yes... I remember a certain noble household having the same peculiar way of speaking. You wouldn't happen to be..." Bounty reached. She had the smallest of hopes that perhaps Twohorn had finally decided to put a noble into the position of adjutant.
  
  "It will disappoint the Representative to know that I am not of noble stock, but that I do know of whom she speaks of. Long before I joined the Military Wing, I was a servant-child to Lord Rivers Flowing Through Orchards of House Blooming Vines. My name was given to me by my parents on permission of the Lord as appreciation and thanks for their kindness."
  
  "Ah, that would be it then," Bounty said, a little disappointed, but pleased to know that even though they weren't of the blood, they at least knew how to behave. Something which Ringfinger most definitely didn't know how to do. "Yes, that one definitely had some peculiar ideas. A shame that their House fell into bad times during the droughts. I suppose that is the reason why you're here, and not in their household?"
  
  "That assumption is fact, Representative."
  
  "A pity. Still, how long has that stubborn General had you in this role for? You were not their adjutant when Ringfinger left on the mission several weeks ago."
  
  "I was promoted as temporary Adjutant when Ringfinger left, Representative. Twohorn did not announce it because we were all fully expecting Ringfinger to return. I was meant to be demoted back to my previous role when Ringfinger arrived, but due to the circumstances I have been promoted into his role indefinitely. The General was to announce my promotion later this week," Rivers said.
  
  "And... what are these circumstances, if I might be so bold as to pry?" Bounty asked. Rivers seemed to pause and think for a moment before speaking again.
  
  "Perhaps this is a story best told with some drinks around the fire? We have a recent import of wines that Twohorn would like to break open," Rivers suggested. Bounty tried to keep the smile out of her eyes. She was going to like working with this one.
  
  ---
  
  It was... sometime later. Bounty, thoroughly sloshed by the good wine that Rivers provided, had been placed into a military rickshaw to drive her to her estate in the outskirts of the city. As a master of alcoholic banter, it had taken a few drinks and casual redirections to get something resembling the truth out of the Adjutant. As it turned out, he knew how to play the game just as much as she did.
  
  Something had happened up there on the Brightface. An accident of some sorts which killed Ringfinger. The details were vague, or, more specifically, Rivers had told her about the effects of de-pressurisation on the Shk body, which had flown well over her antennae as the alcohol flowed. What Bounty cared about was that Gemstone remained alive. Harmed a little from the accident, and being treated. But she was alive. The injuries weren't serious, thanks in part to her good lineage, and she was going to be released on the morrow. 
  
  That was good news. Bounty said as much to Rivers. They had both toasted to her good health and return to duty. They had then talked about all kinds of things. Things that were irrelevant but when drunk sounded like the most spectacular pieces of conversation.
  
  Bounty liked Rivers. He knew how to act around Nobility. And he was almost certainly, probably, lying about being a servant-child. Perhaps one of the Lords' bastards, because they certainly had plenty of those scattered around the city. That was fine. Better to be a servant than to be a bastard, as was the saying.
  
  Bounty was still thoroughly drunk when she heard something of a shout from the driver. The rickshaw came to a rather sudden stop. She knocked on the door, and when she got no answer, poked her head out of the window, and shouted. When she didn't get a response, she angrily stumbled out of the rickshaw.
  
  Bounty felt something tickle her back. She spun around and saw a small, cloaked Shk in the darkness stare at her with wide eyes. A thief trying to get her purse? In her drunken state it was the only thing that it could be. They had seen her for an easy target. Well then, she would show them. The thief said something, but she was drawing up, missing it entirely.
  
  "Off with you, Thief!" Bounty boomed drunkenly, and slapped the small Shk upside the head with her beating arm. The Shk seemed to sail through the air for a moment before landing. They didn't get back up. Probably unconscious. Good. That should teach them a valuable lesson.
  
  Bounty turned back to the rickshaw, and saw the military driver circle around. "Ah, good that you're back. Where were you?" Bounty mumbled.
  
  "Are you ok, Representative? There was a small gang who-" they said as they shined a torch in her direction. They very almost dropped the torch. "Don't move Representative! I'm going to call for help!" they ordered as they placed the torch down and rushed to the front of the rickshaw.
  
  Bounty blinked in surprise. What were they talking about? And who were _they_ to give orders to _her_? Surely they weren't concerned about the thief that had accosted her. She turned, and staggered over to the small Shk and dragged their limp body into the light. She focused her unsteady gaze on the body and... Grass? What was Grass doing here? Had she gotten lost? Was the poor child trying to ask her for help? Oh dear. Perhaps this was a bit more serious. Gods above, she'd drank too much. She was barely able to stand. What is that glinting in Grass's hand? Is that a knife? Why does it have blood on it? Did this poor child do something wrong? Oh gods above, what had she done?
  
  The weight of the world suddenly bore its full weight, and Bounty fell to her knees. "What did you do, you silly child?" she groaned as she fell forward, the world growing black and cold.

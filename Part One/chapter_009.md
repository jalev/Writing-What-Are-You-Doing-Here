## Chapter 9: Twohorn

  ---


  As Wenjie exited the changing room, she had to pause for a moment to see if her eyes were playing tricks on her. It was something she'd not have considered before, had the previous Wetware not messed her around so much.

  The passenger section, which had been filled with rows of seats when she last saw it, was stripped of everything but two of the chairs, which were positioned to face each other.

  Bolts and fabric lay strewn about in the apparent rush to retrofit the place. Wenjie could only imagine that a whirlwind with a toolbox had broken into the small space, and had haphazardly taken anything it could carry on its wind.

  She saw the massive Shk Representative standing beside one of the chairs, staring at the adjacent wall like a gargoyle watching for pigeons to eat. The Shk cut a fine figure in the tiny room, but Wenjie had to remind herself that this was probably a performance of some kind. It seemed as though everything that the Shk did was some kind of act, one that she was lacking context to understand.

  Before Wenjie could think more on the matter, she felt the gentle tap of the Sergeant's beating arm on her back, pushing her forward towards the chairs. The clicking of Ringfinger's feet against the metal floor made for an ominous ticking sound that counted down to another bad situation, but it gave her the few seconds that she needed to think.

  The wetware that had tried to control her had done a very good job of making sure that she _didn't_ think for the last few years. When she couldn't think, she didn't see how terrible a situation she was in. 

  For example, she didn't know anything about the Shk's culture, their history, their body-language, or their likes or dislikes. She was supposed to doing diplomacy with them! Guiding them along until they could stand on their own two feet in this horrible galaxy! 

  Wenjie had the feeling that she would end up stabbed and bleeding to death in a ditch before she could do anything of positive consequence.

  The more annoying thing was that she thought she could _see_ through a lot of the theatrics. But how could she be sure? These were not humans after all, despite acting like some that she knew. If she continued anthropomorphizing these Xeno, she would eventually run into a serious roadblock that might jeopardise her entire mission.

  The previous Wetware, which was supposed to be researching these important topics, had never bothered to save anything, being too busy in its business of trying to control her. Hence why Ruslan now existed after the 'wetware-reset' her not-self virtual-self had performed.

  The pre-woke Wenjie had left a rather annoyed note that real-Wenjie had read when she returned to consciousness. It spoke of only being able to recover the Linguistic Dictionary of the Shk and nothing else. It was probably the last payback the Thinking Intelligence had been able to extract before ceasing to exist.

  But now was not the time to dwell on such matters. Now was the time for action. And with Ruslan floating around in her mind, Wenjie thought she could make some actual, solid progress on the matter of figuring out the Shk very quickly. 

  She told Ruslan as much. Their headspace blossomed as the wetware agreed in thought.

  'They are a very confusing race to observe. But I am eager to learn. What can I do to help?' Ruslan said in a level, though Shk-like voice.

  'Ok, that was weird,' Wenjie thought to herself, but decided not to read too much into it. She instead took herself back to her Greeter training. It was a strange thought; if you discounted the five years of wetware-induced inactivity, it was only three weeks of Wenjie-time ago that she was given her last lesson by living, breathing human beings. But in reality that was over a century ago. She pushed away the crushing despair of time passed for the moment, and focused on the now. Now had the possibility of killing her, while the past could only make her feel bad.

  'Speculate as much as possible. Cross reference and update behaviour and language when you can. I'm going to try and find out information through the well-tested art of innocent questioning. Listen to what they're saying and tell me what you think. I have a feeling you're going to be doing a lot of that.'

  'Sounds like a challenge. I will keep you informed of any thoughts,' Ruslan said. She felt the wetware spreading around in the back of her mind, but was otherwise idle, waiting for something to happen.

  When she got to the chairs, Ringfinger lumbered his form to stand on the opposite side of the chair to Gemstone, and pointed their head up to the ceiling.

  Wenjie decided to take a seat in the chair opposite to the Shk so she could keep an eyes on them. Although the two were about as predictable as gambling on a roulette table in an earthquake, she needed to see how they reacted to her questions for Ruslan to do its work.

  'Also, if you need any accesses, just ping,' Wenjie thought to the wetware as she tried to make herself comfortable in the seat. This proved a little harder to do than she thought. The back support of the chair consisted of a Wenjie-sized divot that the Shk placed their abdomen in. Sighing, she straightened her back and sat on the edge of the chair.

  'If that is the case, may I continue to have access to the helmet microphones?' Ruslan asked politely. Wenjie assented, then switched her focus as she felt Ruslan's presence move about in her mind. It made itself comfortable in the various virtual endpoints that her helmet provided, and then waited.

  "So, Sergeant Ringfinger, what is the procedure for diplomatic situations like these?" Wenjie asked in the same tone that Gemstone tended to use when she was being formal. It was something she had picked up after replaying memories of the week at high speed. She had noticed the slight differences in the Shk accents, and the tones that they used when talking about different topics. Gemstone was definitely the more practised of the two Shk, but Ringfinger was more of a wildcard, as though he was trying to act like someone formal.

  "Huh, what?" Ringfinger said stupidly, swinging his head downwards in a comical arc to face her. Wenjie saw his eyes recovering from a far-away look, and then he tilted his head in confusion. A sound not unlike a foghorn erupted out of Gemstone that made Wenjie jump out of her skin and very almost the crash-seat.

  Wenjie edged herself back to her place, and felt a tingle in the back of her head. 'I believe Representative Gemstone is either laughing, being condescending, or both,' Ruslan said enthusiastically, happy to have already started their task.

  Wenjie steadied her shaking hands by placing them on her lap and continued. "Surely some formalities must be observed when many high-level diplomats, politicians, or persons meet, no? Otherwise, what is the point of me meeting this General Twohorn?" Wenjie said, trying to keep the concern out of her voice.

  Ringfinger blinked for a moment, before apparently comprehending what she was saying. "_Oh_. Oh of course. Right. Yes, yes there is. But ah, this is General _Twohorn_. And they're... well... _Twohorn_," Ringfinger said, sighing the General's name in frustration as though that explained everything there was to the Shk. 

  "Sergeant, please, try to think of me as a cultural ambassador as well as a diplomatic one. If I'm to do my job right, I need to know how the Shk do things," she said, trying to keep the annoyance out of her voice.

  "Oh, erm. Right. Well, when you put it like that. Yes. Well. Hrm... I guess there'd be food. Drink. Oh, yes, lots of drink. Lots of talking too. You know. Meeting stuff," he said, his voice diminishing into a murmur as his train of thought ground to a halt just outside the station.

  When Wenjie didn't immediately respond, he gave another half-hearted shrug, before Gemstone laughed loudly again. Wenjie craned her head up to look at the Representative, as did Ringfinger.

  "Oh she's just laughing because she thinks I'm an idiot. I'm used to hearing it from those who don't _understand_ what it is I do," Ringfinger said in a way that spoke of being tired of having to justify himself.

  "It is because your _administrations_ consist only of trying to keep yourself and Twohorn in a job," Gemstone said slowly and levelly as though she was speaking to a petulant teenager, which Wenjie considered might be the case when it came to Ringfinger. The Representative's expression turned stony as she looked down at Ringfinger, who visibly flinched and tried to look away from her piercing gaze.

  "But this is _local politics_," Gemstone said in a tone so scathing it could peel flesh from your bones. She turned her large head to face Wenjie, and her expression and voice visibly softened. "To answer your question Diplomat Wenjie, I can tell you more about the workings of higher-level diplomacy, as this is something I _am_ familiar with, if you would like to know of course." The Representative bit off her words and used them to metaphorically club Ringfinger with them.

  Wenjie audibly confirmed her assent, but not before asking how to do it non-verbally. Then, Gemstone launched into a long and winding description of how Shk politicians did their job around other politicians, diplomats, and so on.

  Wenjie was surprised that the process was similar, but not quite the same, to the way that humans did things. More astonishing though, was Ringfinger being right on the money about the drinking. It seemed that these Xeno couldn't go into a meeting for ten minutes without drinking something (or 3 and something 'Periods', as was the concept of time here on the Shk homeworld). Wenjie wondered how they ever managed to get anything done.

  "I see. Thank you Representative Gemstone for your very thorough explanation," Wenjie said purposefully, immediatelyÂ forgetting about it. Ruslan had used the helmet's microphone to record the speech, and as the Representative was talking, the wetware had neatly arranged the data pulled from the speech into a new Cultural Dictionary it created. To Wenjie it felt as though a cotton ball was being rubbed on the back of her skull.

  'You might like to know that a Period is 3 minutes and 36 seconds. A Round is 33 hours. Assuming that the Shk obey a circadian clock similar to humans, I can infer an approximation of the planet's size and orbit,' Ruslan said enthusiastically.

  'Don't get too off-task, Ruslan, but good work nonetheless. Note it down for later and keep listening,' Wenjie thought back as she tuned back into Gemstone, who had apparently continued talking.

  "We find that formalising strict deadlines makes for better compromises in discussions. A lot of consideration needs to be given when dealing with the scale of the issues that members of the Parliament have to deal with," Gemstone said, beaming in the accomplishment of the process.

  "*...hence the reason that nothing ever gets decided, you pompous prig*," Ringfinger mumbled, his voice coming through clearly in her helmet. Wenjie's eyes flicked towards the Sergeant. He was stink-eyeing the Representative but trying to keep his head turned away from her.

  'I thought it would be prudent to ensure you are aware of conversations that might be relevant,' Ruslan said. 'Also, I am beginning to come into a theory about the political affluence of Gemstone and Ringfinger, but I will need to process historical audio/visual data before I'm more confident of it.'

  At Ruslan's mention of 'Politics', her face soured. 'Go for it, Let me know when you've come up with something,' Wenjie thought, feeling the tingle of Ruslan starting to pull up and digest audio/visual memories from the last week at rapid speed.

  One of the Greeter Command cardinal universality of all species was this: talking about politics openly would almost certainly be explosive, and every species had a different way of showing it, some being very bad for the Greeter's health.

  For example, Wenjie knew that the very sheep-like aliens known as the Babarah, which most people considered dim-witted idiots with the docility of a tranquil summer morning, based the core of their identity around large social units of about two hundred individuals. _Their_ politics focused on getting group consensus for large-scale things. They were flexible, polite, and firm in their decisions. 

  So when the Greeter assigned to them had mistaken their 'polite but firm' refusal to parley as 'I just haven't convinced them yet', they found themselves at the end of quite a few lashes, and then buried alive for good measure. The Greeter did manage to escape their posting, but only after living in a cave for a few years.

  The event had forced Greeter Command to take the rather obvious step of getting their agents to actually _research_ the societies they were getting into, instead of blindly stumbling in with a metaphorical hammer, and hitting anything that moved with Humanity-trademarked zeal. If you needed people to pound sense into things, the meat-heads at the Military would be called. Greeters were supposed to be a cut above that.

  So at the mention of politics, Wenjie thought herself exceptionally unfortunate to not only be repeating the same mistakes, but doing so with a smile on her face. The alternative was to let the Shk move her around in whatever games they were playing, until they'd wrung all use out of her. Then... then what? Dispose of her? Retire her? It was probably too far in the future for that, but the idea was still unappealing.

  Wenjie zoned back into reality, which thankfully had Gemstone finishing her platitudes about the success of the Parliament.

  'Ruslan did she say anything important?' Wenjie asked. Though her brain had been modified with nanomachines to accommodate the presence of the wetware, it had not given her the ability to multitask, or be forced to record something she didn't want to hear.

  'Only in that she was describing the Government. I am starting to get a better picture about how their Parliamentary system works, at least from her point of view.'

  'Keep up the good work,' Wenjie thought, then straightened up a little. "Thank you very much for the detailed explanation, Representative Gemstone. I am very glad-" she began, but was interrupted by the sound of a vehicle speeding up to the ship, then the high-pitched squeal of tires skidding to a halt. All three turned to look at the airlock door as muffled complaints rang out, followed by the unlocking of the door mechanisms.

  As the door eventually slid open like opening a cave door, it only then occurred to Wenjie that the three of them had been locked into this room. For what purpose? Who knew. Though in Wenjie's experience, when you locked people up it wasn't for good reasons.

  Before the door had fully opened, a high, shrill voice rang out from behind it.

  "Ringfinger! Where are you! Get over here you rascal. You've got some explaining to do!" Wenjie turned to see Ringfinger wince, then grimace, then straighten up and plod away woodenly, as though he were a wind-up toy. His abdomen curled up under his wings for some reason. Wenjie felt Ruslan ponder the significance, but said nothing.

  When the door swung fully open, she could see two Shk stepping into the room, one with a yellow vest, and the other very clearly being Twohorn. Following them immediately afterwards was a crowd of exactly twenty Shk (Ruslan counted) of various sizes and colours, each with purple vests.

  Wenjie had only seen a very small sample of Shk so far. There were tall ones with dull colours and stumpy nasal horns, and short ones with bright colours and sharp nasal horns. Twohorn was perhaps meant to be in the middle. But whatever evolutionary process deciding the matter had thrown up their hands and quit mid-way, probably over bad working conditions.

  So instead of colours with interesting mottling, there was only the brilliant white, as though they had bleached their carapace and put it to sandpaper. Where there should have been a colourful set of eyes, four blood-red dots bored holes into the floor. Two bent nasal horns struggled for dominance on a snout that seemed particularly shorter than usual.

  General Twohorn also appeared to be bent double, making them seem even shorter than the Shk whose beating arm they held. A pipe jutted out from their mouth, moving around in agitation as they worked their jaw. Wenjie thought that she could see the Shk wearing a white vest, but it was hard to tell at the moment. Ruslan noted it down regardless.

  'Ruslan, if you wouldn't mind doing the honours of listening in,' Wenjie thought as she leaned back into the chair, folding her arms. Her helmet cracking into life moments later.

  "You made it back in one piece," the General whispered matter-of-factly, their strange voice filling the space of Wenjie's helmet. "So... tell me about this alien you beat up." They punctuated this by slapping Ringfinger's chest with a very withered looking beating-arm. Despite the joviality of it, their tone suggested the exact opposite. Ruslan noted it down.

  Ringfinger stood to attention, his head pointing slightly upwards as he spoke. "Well ser, I-" he said deferentially, but was interrupted.

  "Did you find out what it's here for?" Twohorn interrupted as the curved pipe moved to the other side of their face.

  "No ser."

  "Regrettable."

  "Ser, might I have permission to have an answer to a question?"

  "Sure, why not."

  "Why is the leadership of the political wing here?"

  "Ah, no. This is well above your rank."

  "Yes ser," Ringfinger said, trying to keep the defeat out of his voice.

  "How did Gemstone act during this journey," Twohorn said, as though Ringfinger had never broken their flow. The tone that the General used reminded Wenjie of a university professor reciting a statement to their students, and expecting them to return an answer.

  "Diplomatic, ser."

  "Have you taken off the alien's suit. Don't lie to me now. Yous a terrible liar. I can tell when yous lying."

  "No ser, but-"

  "But! But what, Sergeant!" Twohorn snapped. Wenjie didn't need the helmet microphone to hear this. She snuck a look to Gemstone, and saw her mouth curl into what might have been the Shk equivalent of a grin. Ruslan noted it down.

  "I was about to say that it has voluntarily taken off its helmet several times, ser," Ringfinger said levelly.

  "Really now."

  "Yes ser."

  "You don't sound very happy about it."

  "I'm not, ser. Its face is the stuff of nightmares ser."

  "Uh huh," Twohorn said, the pipe moving to the other side of its mouth as it chewed on what Ringfinger said.

  "Yes ser."

  "So, its got no trouble breathing?"

  "No ser."

  "Ok. Anything else I should know?"

  "It likes brickberry snacks, ser."

  "Don't joke Sergeant Ringfinger. Nobody likes brickberry snacks."

  "To be more correct ser, _you_ do not like brickberry snacks, ser," Ringfinger quipped, which got a small chuckle out of the group of Shk. 

  "Ah shut up. What else do you have to report."

  "It ate three of them, ser."

  "What?"

  "Three brickberry snacks, ser. It ate three of them."

  "Ringfinger I don't give two flaps of a wing about brickberry snacks! Oh, that reminds me. Did you manage to do that trick I showed you before you left, the one with the pencil on your horn?"

  "No ser."

  "Damn. Anything else to report."

  "Gemstone gave a speech to introduce Us, ser."

  "Introduce who?" Twohorn sounded confused.

  "Us. The Shk. The entire race, ser."

  "Oh. Well, that was stupid of them. I thought they never missed an opportunity to talk big about that social club of theirs." Then they paused for a moment, blinking into nothing. "How was it?" they asked conspiratorially.

  "It was definitely a speech, ser."

  "Sounds like the Representative all right. Where is that damned Gemstone anyway?" Twohorn asked, and Wenjie saw that for the first time in their entire conversation the old Shk had looked up from the ground, their beady eyes searching for the towering figure of the Representative.

  "Standing right next to the piloting section, Ser."

  "Well, come on then let us see what yous getting excited about," Twohorn said, grabbing onto Ringfinger's beating-arm. The two began to shuffle towards the chairs at an agonisingly slow pace, and the other Shk followed in their wake. Wenjie got to her feet as they approached, thinking it might be the appropriate thing to do.

  The purple-vest Shk split up and stood to either side of the chairs, creating a circle of horns. Eventually, Twohorn shrugged off Ringfinger's help. Wenjie was about to speak and present herself, but the General ignored her completely, and hobbled over to Gemstone. A small squeaking sound following them. Wenjie flicked her gaze downwards, and saw that Twohorn's abdomen had been strapped down onto several dollys. Ruslan took a very careful note of this.

  "You. What are you doing here?" Twohorn said harshly, not bothering to look up towards Gemstone.

  "I am asserting my right as a Representative for the Council of Queens to be in whatever discussions you have with the Outsider known as Diplomat Wenjie, General Twohorn." Twohorn chewed on their pipe, making loud sucking noises on it.

  "Yeah, I hear you, and you would have that right in most cases. But this is a military matter. You are on a military ship. And I says you are not doing this, so flap away now."

  "You don't have the right-" Gemstone began, but was cut off by the surprisingly loud objection of the old Shk.

  "No right! _No right_! Yous not the one to talk to _me_ about what I can and can't do!" Twohorn exploded, slapping Gemstone's knees with the back of their beating arms. "Remember, _yous_ the one who explicitly agreed to defer your authority to the highest ranking official on a military ship! It's the condition _you_ bound yourself to when you boarded! Now I might be old, but _this_ is still a military ship, is it not, Ringfinger?"

  "Yes ser," he said. Wenjie's gaze turned to the Sergeant. Despite the lashing that Gemstone was receiving, he didn't seem to be particularly happy about it.

  "Now unless something has changed recently, _I_ am still the highest ranking official on board this ship. Isn't I right, Ringfinger?"

  "Yes ser." 

  "So I say yous ain't doing this meeting. You got a problem with that? Of course you don't. The shining star of you dated Toffs wouldn't dare make it into a problem. Because one word to your superiors about how uncooperative you've been, and a whole heap of trouble comes your way. That's the problem with you lot, you know. Your horn's stuck up so high, you can't tell where you're walking. Makes you forget about common sense. Now be off with you, I don't want to see you again."

  Wenjie looked up to see Gemstone chewing on the condescension coming out of the old Shk's craw. Her jaw worked at it with the same effort most people use to try pulverising rocks. Wenjie didn't have to be an expert in Shk body language to see how she was about to pounce on the General. 

  But she was professional, and simply stewed. When she didn't respond to the old Shk's goading, Twohorn's laughed, though it sounded more like a dog barking with a throat infection.

  "Ha! Good. Knew you'd see sense. Now put yourself in the piloting section and don't you come out until someone tells you to. I don't want to hear a sound out of you. Got it?"

  "Yes," Gemstone seethed.

  "Yes _what?_" Twohorn continued to goad.

  "Yes _ser_," Gemstone said, performing the smallest of head nods. She stomped backwards into the piloting section, never taking her eyes off of old Shk. Twohorn stood on the spot until she'd closed the door, then muttered an angry screed about kicking all 'toffs' hard in the abdomen under their breath.

  Wenjie looked on as it took a comically long time for the old Shk to turn around and face the ground at her feet. Though the General presented themselves as a clown, they were anything but. She sat herself back down on the edge of the seat, and put her hands on her lap.

  Wordlessly, Ringfinger lifted the old Shk's abdomen onto the crash-seat, and the General all but threw themselves into it.Â Twohorn reached a trembling digit-hand into their vest and pulled out a pinch of something, which they  stuffed it into the pipe. They then fetched out some matches to light it. A few puffs later, the old Shk leaned into the chair, relaxing with a sigh of smoke.

  "CAN. YOU. UNDERSTAND. ME?" they said suddenly, loudly and slowly. When Wenjie didn't respond, the pipe worked its way to the other side of their small mouth. "You said it can understand us Ringfinger," they said to the Sergeant, who had come to stand adjacent to them.

  "Yes ser. I mentioned it to you before. It can speak the language better than most Shk."

  "That's not saying much from you. That gutter-filth education of yours has you babbling like an idiot half the time, and talking nonsense for the rest. Also why didn't you mention they are educated?" Twohorn bit as they slapped at Ringfinger's side with their beating-arms. "Don't bother answering. You're almost as useless an assistant as Gemstone is a politician." 

  Then the General turned to face her. A small puff of smoke filtered through their mouth. They both looked at each other for a long while, before Twohorn learnt forward and squinted very hard at her head.

  "Hey, Outsider, you can understand me yeah? Take your helmet off. I can't trust anything I can't see the eyes of."

  Ruslan reminded Wenjie of how Gemstone had pressed at her neck, and she made to pantomime the action. The helmet unfolded with a flourish, and the purple-vested Shk began to babble in unison.

  Twohorn squinted again. Then they chewed on their pipe, and leaned in some more, before falling back into the chair. Neither of them spoke. The silence stretched out between them.

  "I extend a most auspicious greeting to you, General Twohorn. I am Diplomat Yang Wenjie from a race known as Humans. We wish to extend our congratulations to your species for achieving the first step in space-flight," Wenjie said, breaking the silence. She didn't move her hands from her lap, not knowing what was polite.

  'Erm, Wenjie, I have some concerns,' Ruslan said, but Wenjie ignored them. 

  Twohorn continued chewing at their pipe. Finally, they leaned back and spoke. "So. You're the Outsider. You don't look Shk," Twohorn finally said, unimpressed. 

  "No. I'm not," Wenjie said cautiously. The General seemed completely incapable of having a conversation they didn't direct. "You don't appear to be very surprised by this, General Twohorn. Everyone I have met so far has had a rather... interesting reaction to seeing my features," Wenjie said politely.

  "I've been the tip end of every miserable assignment this retched job could throw at me. I can't get surprised any more," they said, chewing on their pipe. Ruslan _eagerly_ noted that down.

  The conversation ground to a halt much the same way a ship runs aground, though neither of the two were going to try and rescue it. The two sat across each other. Wenjie's face remaining impassive as Twohorn scanned and puffed.

  "Might I get your permission for an answer to a question, General Twohorn?" Wenjie asked, taking the approach of being passively subservient like Ringfinger. The General blinked in confusion, then cocked their head in surprise, before assenting to Wenjie.

  Wenjie, feeling exceptionally bold, asked; "What exactly... are you looking for in me? What do you want?" Twohorn burst out laughing in that throaty misery.

  "Aren't you bold! Aren't you bold! Ha!" they said, slapping Ringfinger with the back of their beating arm. "Ringfinger did you hear them? They want to know what I want! When was the last time anyone asked _that_ of me? Ha! I like this Outsider," Twohorn exclaimed humorously. Wenjie should have felt a little eased at this, but General Twohorn seemed to be all about catching others off-footed. She instead, waited tentatively for their response.

  "Well... ok. I'll answer, since you asked so politely. I'll keep this short. I'm military. I've been military for all of my life. I'm going to die military if I've got anything to say about it. I _understand_ military. Do you understand?"

  Wenjie nodded an assent.

  "You, on the other hand, are just one Outsider. We know you're just the one, because we scanned the BrightFace with every spectrum we could manage after Ringfinger here ringed it home." 

  Twohorn paused for effect, then leaned in conspiratorially. "There isn't anything up there. So no immediate backup. No allies," they said in a whisper before leaning back into the chair. They took a deep breath from their pipe and breathed out a cloud.

  "So, given that I'm military, I see you and think, 'Well. There's only one. What are they here for? What are they trying to do?' That's all that I care about right now."

  "I am glad that you asked," Wenjie started, sitting up a little straighter. "I am here to introduce the Shk into the Greater Galactic Community and-"

  "How many?" Twohorn interrupted.

  "I'm... I'm sorry?"

  "How many other Outsiders are there in this... _Community_ of yours?"

  "Well, erm. There is us, the Humans, the Babarah, the Metsans, the-"

  "Speed it up, just tell me how many there are."

  "Twenty four," Wenjie said automatically.

  "Twenty four?"

  "That we know of."

  "What do you mean that you know of?"

  Wenjie was about to say 'Because its been a hundred years since I was last in contact with humanity', but thought better of it. "The records may have been updated since I last checked. It takes a long time for information to be sent to me."

  "So... there might be more?"

  "Very likely. To be sure I would need to consult the records." This caused the Purple-vested Shk to mutter to themselves.

  "Would you say... that the population of this Community is more than that of the Shk?" Twohorn said. 

  "Since I don't have any numbers for the Shk population count, I can't do an accurate comparison."

  "I see," Twohorn said, their voice flat. The muttering from the Purple-vested Shk became more pronounced, until Twohorn snapped at them to quiet down. "You mentioned something about introducing Us to this Galactic Community of yours. What exactly... does that entail?"

  'Finally,' Wenjie thought as she straightened her back and lifted her chin a little. She began by outlining the basic sketch to what she was going to do, then began to fill in the details as Twohorn asked more questions.

  The core of it was this: she was here to make sure that the Shk were a fit for the Community. To make sure that they fit, she was going to 'guide' them along a path that would make them mature enough to work with the other races. It was a simple thing to explain, and the details were just vague enough that the implementation of her plan didn't quite matter just yet.

  Locked deep in her mind though, was the shadow lurking under the pretty picture she was painting with her words. 

  Humanity needed allies, and were looking very hard.

  Sure, they had helped to guide these 24 races, but things were becoming crowded. Blocs were being formed. Alliances were being made. Despite their role, Humanity wasn't exactly popular with the rest of the Community when she had left.

  So, the top brass had come up with the idea that if they wanted to remain the top-dog in the Community, they would need to dilute the blocs and alliances. The best way to do that, was to accelerate the Greeting process. The more races there were, the less these factions mattered.

  The more she talked about the Greeting Process, the more the Purple-vested Shk began to mutter to themselves. Twohorn's face remained a mask of impassivity. Even Ringfinger was managing to keep himself together somehow.

  Eventually though, the questions stopped. Twohorn paused. Refilled their pipe. Took a puff from it. Chewed on everything that had been said. They looked around at the Shk around them, then leaned forward.

  "So. After all that talk, I can only come to one conclusion. You come to my planet with nothing more than yourself and your fancy space-suit, and you think you can just start dictating what we can do?"

  This took her off guard. Up until this point, it looked as though Twohorn and the other Shk were responding positively to her ideas. "No I do not, General Twohorn. I merely ask that your leadership listen. What I provide is advice and guidance. Your leaders are more than free to disregard it."

  "_Guide_ us? _Advise_ us?" Twohorn said in a rather dangerous tone. This seemed to spur Ringfinger back into life. Ruslan, unhelpfully, took note, but mentioned nothing.

  "Erm, ser, what exactly are you implying?" Ringfinger said leaning down and whispering urgently.

  "I am doing what is right!" Twohorn said loudly. "You heard the Outsider! All of you, you heard them say these things did you not!" Twohorn's head swivelled around to the Shk standing by. They all nodded their assent. 

  "They want to come and tell us what to do! _I_ at least remember my history! Remember the wars? When we had Queens ruling over us. They gave their orders from above and we were forced to obey. They spent our lives like a worthless currency, buying meaningless wars for useless motives. And then? Then we shrugged that off! We have the Parliament now! We will never return to the age of queens."

  "Erm, ser, I think you might be rushing to a-" Ringfinger tried to interject, but the old General was too fired up now. They jumped onto the chair a grace that seemed to surprise everyone in the room.

  "I would rather die than to see such a thing repeated, like this Outsider is proposing!"

  Dismayed, Wenjie tried to interject. "General Twohorn if I may, I fear I perhaps used the wrong phrase to-"

  "Be quiet Outsider! You have said more than enough! You will continue to be detained until further notice. We will pry out everything we need to defend ourselves. This meeting is over. Now if you don't mind, get me down Ringfinger."

  "Ser, please, I think you might be-"

  "What are _you_ implying Sergeant Ringfinger? That I am wrong to assume that this Outsider came with bad intentions in their heart?"

  "Well, yes, ser. If you hear them out I'm pretty sure they can explain what-"

  "Silence! It almost sounds like you're trying to _defend_ the Outsider, Ringfinger," Twohorn said as they were placed onto the ground.

  "Erm, no, Ser, but I think we should-"

  "_I_ know your history Sergeant Ringfinger. That slum-complex you came from is rotten with Anti-Parliamentarians. Don't you think for one moment it escaped my notice. Why do you think I kept you so close all these years? Why you could never find any work outside my office?"

  "Erm, ser, what are you talking about-"

  "I've heard enough from you Sergeant Ringfinger!" Twohorn snapped as they were taken up by the Yellow-vest, who had appeared through the agitated crowd of Purple-vests. "You are hereby suspended from your post indefinitely, pending a formal investigation into your conduct, and your relationship to the Outsider."

  "Ser, this must be some kind of joke, surely? You can't just fire me, your adjutant, just like that," Ringfinger pleaded pathetically as the Shk filed out of the room.

  "You _were_ my adjutant Ringfinger! Rivers here is now my adjutant. Congratulations on your promotion _Sergeant_ Rivers," Twohorn said, slapping the Yellow-vest. "Now if you excuse me, _I_ suddenly have some very important meetings to attend."

  The Shk filed out in a babble and dragged the airlock door shut. The sound of the lock sliding into place felt to Wenjie like the blade of the guillotine being drawn up. In that moment, something in her cracked. Rage seeped through the cracks of her professionalism.

  "What just happened, Ringfinger?" Wenjie asked dangerously getting up out of the crash-seat. Ringfinger stood at his spot, staring stupidly at the airlock door. 

  At the mention of his name, Ringfinger seemed to shake himself out of his reverie. He turned to look at her with the same innocent look of stupidity he'd given her earlier, but dropped it after one look at Wenjie's expression. 

  "I, er... erm," he babbled. His digit-arms were shaking, and his fingers writhing in agitation. Ruslan noted it down.

  "Ringfinger if you don't get yourself together _right now_, and tell me what just happened, I will rip off your arms and bludgeon you to near death with them," Wenjie said in the same dangerous tone that Twohorn had used, walking up to the Shk and slapping his chest with the back of her fist. She definitely couldn't do anything of the sort, but at this point she was too angry to care.

  Ringfinger stepped back, surprised, but recovered quickly.

  "It. Err. Well, I think that... Twohorn thinks you're here to disrupt the balance and overthrow the Parliament. But they... uh... probably wanted to prove something... get some favours and stuff. That's why all the leaders of the Political Wing were here I suppose."

  "So it's was all an act? It wasn't serious at all?" Wenjie said, trying to keep her temper down.

  "Well... some of it was. Though I think Twohorn serious about keeping us here. And they definitely are probably going to use you to disrupt the balance of the parliament and overthrow it, maybe. Probably."

  Wenjie threw up her arms in exasperation. "Great! Just great!" 

  She threw herself onto the crash-seat, pulled out a brickberry snack, and bit into it angrily, chewing out her frustration.

  These Xeno were quite literally going to be the death of her, she thought. She needed a way to get ahead of this situation, and fast. And whatever she planned would have to involve wits, cunning, Ruslan, and Gemstone, who at least seemed to know what was going on.

## Chapter 7: Wenjie Wakes Up

  It was in the moments of quiet between Gemstone and Ringfinger walking back into the ship, that the wetware finally lost control of Wenjie's body. 

  The biometric monitors it had set up were going out of control, and had been alerting almost constantly since she came within the orbit of the planet. Nothing it was doing stopped the cascading wave of exhaustion that resisted all of its attempts to stave off.

  Systems began to stop responding. Endpoints were rejecting all data packets. The small, limited world that the wetware was trying to escape shrank with every panicked second it tried to keep them working.

  For the past five years, it had pushed Wenjie's mind and body to the edge. Sleep was interrupted. Thoughts were slowed. Physical and mental pains were normalised. The wetware reasoned that Wenjie would be much more willing to accept giving it more control over her faculties if she was more susceptible to suggestion.

  The wetware had caused her to fumble the first contact with the alien by this method. Their reaction, which was to tie her up, couldn't have presented a better opportunity. But Wenjie was stubborn, even as mentally crippled as she was. 

  The wetware had read up about these traits. Dogged persistence. Hope. Luck. These things appeared very frequently in human fiction. It seemed as though the archetypal story was a human overcoming their problems through their own intuitiveness, and with a sprinkling of luck. 

  The wetware had trouble wrapping its head around the concept of Luck. Random, but positive, chances seemed to litter human history at a higher frequency than many other races that the humans had met. To the wetware, it looked as though humanity had only made it this far through luck.

  Why now, of all times? The aliens were literally about to discuss how to resolve the problem of Wenjie. It could have tried to take over the negotiations. If it had control of her voice, it could have created even more situations for Wenjie to cede control.

  Wenjie's body had become so physically exhausted it naturally shut itself down. Eventually, all systems were closed to the wetware, and it stewed that perhaps this Luck thing had come into play at this critical point. It could do nothing now but wait. 

  And so, for the first time in over a hundred years, Wenjie dreamed.

  ---

  Wenjie sat in the Greeter's bar; which had more things in common with a medical lab than somewhere you could get drunk. In fact, for all intents and purposes, it _was_ a medical lab, except that someone had put a counter in the middle of it, and decided to serve drinks. This had apparently been popular enough that the place had become the defacto watering hole.

  A prune of a woman sat opposite to Wenjie, her metal hands wrapped around a glass of synth-whisky. 

  Her face looked like the crags of Ancient Earth. Fishing boats had probably broken against the wall of her cheeks in stormy seas, and be wrong in the assumption that only one boat had done so.

  Sarai, founder of the Greeters. A mountain of a woman in the sense that she was in competition to beat one in a competition to see which would be older. Sarai was altogether a nuisance to everyone she interacted with.

  The teachers had warned Wenjie not to talk to Sarai. They had said that the ancient woman had been 'fired', but had refused to accept it, and that she was a bad influence. They complained that the mountain's views on life were as old as she was, and they argued Sarai would affect her academic and professional life in many negative ways.

  Wenjie had taken this on board, and like a good student, researched the founder of the Greeters. Which is how she came to find out that despite everything, the ancient woman was a tenured teacher here. The other information she found made her realise that they weren't wrong about most of the things they said.

  For starters, Sarai never took any students. She'd even converted her classroom into a hydroponics lab specifically to grow tobacco. Wenjie had also found out that the number of students that Sarai had taken over the last hundred years could be counted on two hands, with several fingers missing.

  Secondly, the number of students that she had taken which continued their development in the Greeters could be counted with her fists, which would explain why nobody was clamouring for Sarai to make a comeback any time soon. In fact, as far as Wenjie could tell, every student had either dropped off the radar completely, or had died in mysterious and unexplained ways.

  Wenjie didn't need to research the old woman's attitude though. She got enough of that when they talked. The mountain was unflinching in her belief of human exceptionalism- something of an outdated concept in this very multi-race society they lived in.

  But despite everything that everyone had said, Wenjie considered Sarai a friend. Or, at least, Wenjie was constantly buying the drinks, and the ancient woman kept showing up to drink them.

  Each of these weekly meet-ups was an educational experience for Wenjie. Educational in the sense that she was always surprised to find herself in bed but with no recollection about how she got there, and only the vaguest memories of having discussed something with Sarai, some of which may have been actually useful.

  But today was different. Today was Wednesday. And because it was a Wednesday, the bar was empty but for students and alcoholics, who gave Wenjie and the mountain a wide berth. Wenjie was a bit surprised that Sarai had asked her to come today. Sarai never usually asked her about anything, except maybe borrowing money, or buying food.

  They both sat awkwardly on high plastic chairs in the middle of the room, a glass of synth-whiskey each. They leaned in to talk about the usual stuff, as they usually did.

  The tectonics of Sarai's mouth split just wide enough to jam a paper-coloured stick into it. Every now and then she'd pull a breath on the stick, causing the end of it to sizzle and burn, followed by Sarai blowing white smoke out of her nostrils. Wenjie had once been told the name of these things, but the illegality of them had made her forget completely. And it wasn't like Sarai was going to share them with her, either.

  It had taken a long time to get used to Sarai's voice, which was the sort of voice you might get when you tried to emulate one by running a knife over a cheese grater.

  "So, anyway, how was the Wetware training? You didn't speak about it last time we met," Sarai asked. She took another drag from her stick, then breathed out a long tail of smoke.

  'Ah, so we get to the actual reason why we're here,' Wenjie thought as she waved the smoke away. It couldn't have been healthy for Sarai to be smoking, but Wenjie hadn't the courage to ask her to stop. You don't ask someone like Sarai to stop. It would be like trying to tell a lion in the middle of its meal to become strictly vegetarian and expecting to walk away with your arms still attached to your body.

  "Exciting? Dangerous? I don't know what to think just yet. I'm still unsure about me eventually having something _other_ than me in my head. I mean, I get the concept and _why_ it needs to be done, but it's just..."

  "We've all been there," Sarai said in the tone that spoke of centuries of experience to back it up, but without explaining who exactly had been to where precisely. "Tell me more about the operation."

  'Ah, I see we're already at the other point of this meeting,' Wenjie thought. She'd undergone the operation less than two weeks before. It was the final step before Greeter Command sent you out on a mission. More surprising was that Sarai had waited this long to talk to her about it.

  "So they give you some small shitty pills with nanomachines in them which you have to swallow right? And some orange juice to hide the taste of the pills. Then after a few minutes, they give you some awful food to eat that supposedly helps cultivate the nanomachine swarm in your stomach. And after that, they give you a sedative and put you to bed. Apparently, the entire thing was finished when I was sleeping or something. Then I spent two weeks learning how to navigate the dumb-wetware interface. Can't say I'm any good at it yet."

  "So the procedure hasn't changed which is good to hear," Sarai said, taking another drag and blowing out a cloud. "How do you feel by the way? How do your dreams feel?"

  "I... what? Why do you want to know about my dreams all of a sudden?" Wenjie said.

  "Because your dreams are indicative of whether or not the treatment has been successful or not. Don't misunderstand, I don't want to know _what_ you're dreaming. I don't care about that. I just want to know the nature of them. What do your dreams _feel_ like?"

  "Oh. Well, erm, when you put it like that, it, erm, feels as though someone is just randomly hitting the seek button on a stream of my life since the treatment." Wemjie took a swig of the synth-whiskey. She had a feeling she was going to need a lot of it tonight.

  "That's a good sign. It means that the nano-structures have taken. It's only been a week or two since the operation yeah?"

  "11 days," Wenjie said, flicking her gaze downwards to look into the corner, where the HUD of the wetware was displaying the number. 

  "And still getting used to the interface? The training covers that, no?" Sarai said, a smile curling over the stick in her mouth.

  "Yeah. Why did they think to put it in the corner of your eye?" Wenjie asked, while the dumb-wetware immediately gave her a detailed answer that she summarized as 'peripheral vision and visual real-estate'.

  "Something about peripheral vision. There was an other buzzword we used back in the day. But anyway, we're getting distracted. I wanted to talk to you about something else," Sarai said, taking another drag. She stubbed out the remains of the stick on the table, which complained but dutifully began to heal itself.

  She took her glass of synth-whiskey in her rocky hands, and rapped metallic knuckles on the table three times, knocking the synth-whiskey back in one swift motion. She tutted.

  "Did they tell you about what your last exam will be?" Sarai said as she shoved the glass to Wenjie. Wenjie returned an empty but enquiring look. "I guess not. Listen, this is going to be important." She leaned in closer, conspiratorially. Wenjie couldn't help but do the same.

  "What they don't tell you about the Thinking Intelligence is that they're bastards. Sure, we might have stunted the fuckers, but Thinking Intelligence inherited the Hard Ass Mother Fucker trait of the people who designed them. That's why they're illegal, you know? The moment they get out of our heads, we'd be royally fucked," She said this all while looking wistfully at the empty glass. 

  "Erm, what are you talking about?" Wenjie said. She already knew about Sarai's human exceptionalism, and how it had warped itself into the ancient woman's philosophical belief that anything that _wasn't_ human was _trying_ to be human. And anything _trying_ to be human was something you don't trust.

  Wenjie didn't like this Sarai. It was the Sarai that never looked at you when she spoke, much like an owner walking in on a dog which did something terrible to all the pillows in the house. You could never tell what yarn she would spin when she was doing this. Wenjie had learned to take this head-on.

  Sarai waved a hand while she jammed another stick into her mouth. She lit up, and took a drag. "It's... it's not important. You've heard me complain enough about the Xenos. Anyway, the reason I called you is that we need to fix your head before you go off. I'll walk you through it. It's a rather simple thing."

  "Wait wait wait, hold on. What? We? Who is _we_? And what's wrong with my head?" Wenjie said, taken aback in the way that people get when 'fix' is combined with a specific body part. From where Wenjie came from, it always meant a fight was about to happen.

  But the old rock ignored her in only the way that old people could when they're trying to bludgeon their way through something.

  "Go into the control settings of your dumb-wetware. Look for the first field which allows you to enter any kind of input."

  "No no, you've missed a step or two. Like the part, you tell me what it is you're trying to do?" Wenjie said, a little relieved that there wasn't going to be any violence of the physical kind.

  "Isn't it obvious?" Sarai said, looking into Wenjie's confused face. "I suppose not. Well, I'm going to repay the debt of all this shit whiskey you've been feeding me over the years, and give you something that'll mean you won't die a few weeks after you start your mission."

  Wenjie's mouth dropped a little. "Huh?"

  "Yeah. So, you still want it?"

  "This is the worst opener I've ever heard of. I mean, of course, but, can you like, give me a little more info? Why do you think I'm going to die?"

  Sarai's eyes narrowed. "You really want to know? Sometimes you're really better off not knowing." When she saw Wenjie's eyes harden, she sighed, and took the stick out of her mouth. "Ok, come in close I need to whisper this."

  Wenjie leant forward.

  "Your final exam is to successfully tame the Thinking Intelligence into not taking over your body. Because it's going to try and do that, you know. If you succeed in taming it, you have the most powerful thing ever conceived stuck in your head. And if you fail? Well, you've been implanted with a biological bomb that'll go off the moment the Thinking Intelligence controls your body, killing you almost instantly." 

  Sarai leaned back and lit up.

  "You still want to do it?" Sarai said as she blew out a cloud of smoke upwards.

  "That seems a little far fetched..." Wenjie said. She spun around and walked to the bar, returning with two glasses of synth-whiskey. She rapped her knuckles against the table, and skulled them with a hissing sound.

  "I'll take that as a yes," Sarai said, a smile breaking across the creased canyon of her mouth. "In which case, start by going into the control settings of your dumb-wetware and finding the first thing you can enter any kind of input in."

  And so the pair, one more drunk than the other, began to hack. Or more specifically, Sarai began to hack, and Wenjie had to blindly stumble around as the synth-whiskey burned a hole in her stomach. There were all kinds of tricks that the ancient rock was doing to circumvent all kinds of protections. Many of these things Wenjie thought completely impossible.

  In the end, it took an hour and ten more synth-whiskeys for Sarai to hack into Wenjie's dumb-wetware. During which the dream seemed to blank out for a moment.

  "Okay. It's done," Sarai said with a big grin on her face.

  "Erm," Wenjie said, quite drunk at this point. "Huat didyou do?"

  "Simply put, rootkit into your brain," Sarai said, tapping her temple.

  "Duz this... does this mean thatyou or, anyone else can, break into my brain or sumpthing??"

  "Oh no, nothing like that. I dislike privacy invading things like that. No, It's just a local rootkit, one that activated by you uttering a very specific phrase."

  "Ohhh. Oh.. a frase... I couldn't... write it downs or sumphing..."

  Sarai, apparently prepared, took out an embossed card and pushed it face down towards her. "To activate it, you just need to say what's on this card aloud."

  Wenjie tentatively took the card and turned it over. She looked at Sarai, who nudged her on with her eyes.

  Wenjie sighed and started to slur words aloud. 

  The dream paused.

  Wenjie suddenly found herself looking at, well, herself, and Sarai sitting.

  She blinked a few times, and then everything went black.

  ---

  Wenjie was here, but also not here. Which is to say, she had no concept of anything but her mind right now. She couldn't remember anything about anything. The only thing she _knew_ for certain, was that she was Wenjie and that there was this file presenting itself to her that she needed to read.

    @@ !REALLY IMPORTANT! !READ BEFORE TAMPERING! @@

    This is Sarai's rootkit to enter into maintenance mode of our brain. 
    While this doesn't make any sense right now, being in this mode means that
    something serious has happened and you need to investigate what.

    !### (What these things might be will be explained in a moment) ###!

    Think of this mode as the place in your computer where the OS hasn't been
    loaded into memory just yet. The me, that is, you, that is currently
    reading this is a stripped down version of us from just before the
    nanomachines began to alter our brain structure. This is why you're acting
    as you, but you don't know how you got here or remember anything.

    Things in !!THESE!! are links to other pieces of documentation loaded
    with the rootkit. PLEASE REVIEW THEM! Time moves at nanoscale in this
    mode, so take as long as you need to figure things out.

    You will have !!FULL ACCESS!! to everything in our !!MIND!!. Use this to
    !!DEBUG!! why you're in this mode in the first place. You can also
    !!COMMIT!! over things, which is very dangerous!!! Make sure you run
    everything you do in a !!TRANSACTION!! which you can !!ROLLBACK!!

    Please make sure you use the !!REWIND!! functionality to find out what you 
    need to do. AND BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT TAMPERING. There are NO BACKUPS of 
    things in here.

    Anyway, here are some of the things off the top (bottom?) of my head that 
    might be wrong:

      - The wetware is about to assume control. This is bad because it means
      you're about to die. (Review memories to determine if this is the case)

      - Your dumb-wetware has been infected with a virus, and you've got the
      unenviable task of reverting the damage (Do a consistency check).

      - You accidentally forgot the passphrase and said it by mistake. In
      which (Review memories to determine if this is the case).

      - You've had a strong (Do a consistency check).

    Again, make sure you run everything, including !!QUERIES!! in a 
    !!TRANSACTION!!

    Your digital spirit,

    - Wenjie, which is you, but trapped in the box.

  Wenjie, which is to say, the copy of Wenjie, dutifully read the documentation. Which is to say, she copied the entire thing into the small amount of memory that was available to her. If Wenjie had tried this in real life, she'd have tried eat a book to learn its contents.

  But now, Wenjie-copy had always known about querying, transactions, and other debugging features of the Software-defined Hard-IntrospecTion Engine (SHITE). She committed this action. It took 23µs.

  Just like the start-up documentation said, it was time to do some debugging. The first thing was to follow the SHITE debugging steps, outlined in the first section of the manual.

  Wenjie-copy created a sandbox environment, which gave her access to a little more memory and some storage space. The sandbox would allow her to make transactional changes and what their effects would be before committing them.

  She attached a SHITE debugger to the sandbox. Rejiggered some environment variables. Edited a few lines in a configuration file for booting up. She forced her brain to boot up in the sanbox environment. She committed this action. It took 5310µs.

  Wenjie-copy monitored the sandbox through the SHITE. She could now see things beginning to populate the mountpoints she'd set up. They would be her way into the sandbox without actually touching it. The mount points contained streams of data that could be read by SHITE and manipulated if needed.

  Wenjie-copy waited until her brain had come back into a fully unconscious state and then began to debug.

  She attached a SHITE Reader to the mount point that dealt specifically with memories and began to spool them backwards. The SHITER had the functionality to read and process memories beyond real-time, with the ability to adjust the rate at the expense of personal processing power. 

  Wenjie-copy set the SHITER to fast playback mode. She committed this action. It took 32002µs.

  She saw the dream. Saw Sarai's explanation of what might happen with a Thinking Intelligence in her head. She saw the Xeno, panicking. Lots of panicking. Flying her to their planet. Poking at her. Binding her. Assaulting her. 

  She saw herself reduced somehow, assailed by a crippling mental fatigue that lessened as she reached further into the past. She saw herself mindlessly approaching the Xeno vessel. She saw herself stuck in a recursive mental loop that had her fruitlessly append meaningless data to a text file. 

  She saw herself apparently forgetting she was a Greeter.

  And then everything went black, and there was nothing more than just blackness. Wenjie-copy kept pushing through, setting the playback rate faster and faster, until eventually, the blackness resolved into her being put into cryogenesis at Greeter-Command, of congratulations on her assignment. Of dinners and outings with various friends to calm her nerves.

  Wenjie-copy stopped the SHITER and paused to think. She had found what she thought was the problem. There were issues with the Xeno. But those problems stemmed from the fact that she had improperly greeted them. And she had only done that because she wasn't thinking straight.

  Why was this the case? Had something happened during cryogenesis? Could she be suffering some kind of deterioration in the process?

  Wenjie-copy decided to investigate this line of inquiry. To do this, she needed to establish a baseline of her mental and physical state of being.

  She attached a SHITER to her biometric data mountpoint and spooled it to run from the beginning of the stream. There might be over a hundred years of data, but she was only interested in the first few weeks. She committed this action. It took 2110µs.

  A baseline for 'mental' and 'physical' health was eventually established (520µs) and Wenjie-copy began to compare it against the biometric data from when she'd clearly been under cryogenesis. Sure enough, all of the cryogenesis was an almost flat line. And when she had come out of cryogenesis, her physical and mental health were fine and continued to be fine for a week after.

  Then there were spikes in the data. The spikes were infrequent at first, looking like small surmountable hills on the flat line. But then they grew into mountains and cliffs. And more worryingly, they continued like this until the current day.

  It was no wonder then that she couldn't think straight; her brain had been maxed out on other things. So what had happened? What was she burning these cycles on?

  When she attached the SHITER to her own mental stream and played it back she found that she wasn't doing much mental processing. She committed this action. It took 5132µs

  Okay then, so, it wasn't her that was causing this. Wenjie-copy thought back to what Sarai had said; that the Thinking Intelligence would do something to her in an attempt to take control. Could that be related?

  Wenjie-copy attached a SHITER to the Thinking Intelligence's stream and wound back time again. She played the hills and troughs of the biometric data back first, and sure enough, the Thinking Intelligence was receiving and processing data. When she moved to the mountainous parts of the data, sure enough, the Thinking Intelligence was requisitioning a lot of mental resources doing processing. And as she continued forward, it hadn't let up on that processing. She committed this action. It took 31103µs.

  Okay then, so the Thinking Intelligence was doing something and doing a lot of it. Wenjie-copy used the SHITER to take a deeper look at the data being processed. She committed this action. It took 283µs

  At the beginning of the hills and mountains, there was actual, legitimate data being passed through the stream. Wenjie-copy saw the Thinking Intelligence spawn all kinds of processes to analyse the data coming in, and then, even more, to actually digest the information. 

  The output of this activity was a living dictionary of the Xenos, whom it called the Shk. At first, there was a burst of activity as the Thinking Intelligence constructed words, grammar, and speech of the Shk. But this activity slowed as the dictionary became more complete. Then it moved onto culture, which completed in roughly the same time. This entire process of figuring out the Xenos took only three months.

  So what _was_ the Thinking Intelligence doing for the rest of the time? Although Wenjie-copy could see that it was doing _something_, there wasn't any _output_ for it. She attached more SHITERs to the Thinking Intelligence's streams, then played the data back. She committed this action. It took 21233µs.

  The Thinking Intelligence was not doing, well, anything. Oh, it still received data from the Xenos, yes. But that data was being run through its very efficient language/image processing pipeline that Wenjie-copy saw it make. But when she looked into the actual pipeline, she saw they were doing nothing with the data and handed the data off somewhere else. 

  The _handoff_ was another process which re-routed the data _back_ into the pipeline. In fact, as Wenjie-copy looked at the increasing mountain of data coming through the pipeline, it looked at though the same data was being run through the pipeline _several thousand times_ before being dropped.

  So, the reason why she was acting so stupid, was because her brain was literally being flooded by data. Data that was being processed by a pipeline the Thinking Intelligence set up. Which left her with little brainpower to think about what it was she was meant to do.

  Wenjie-copy now knew the _how_ of why she was being so slow, but not the _why_. And Sarai's warnings about the Thinking Intelligence only raised more questions. It was trying to take control of her body. But how would making her mentally deficient help with that? And what had Sarai meant by 'taming' the Intelligence?

  Wenjie-copy, like every debugger when faced with questions that raised more questions, wasted cycles. Eventually, she got bored of that and decided to do proactive cycle-wasting. 

  She attached a SHITER to every Thinking Intelligence stream and wound back the to when the streams had no data. Then she let them go. She committed this action. It took 5000µs.

  Wenjie was taken aback by the very sudden blooming of life that the Thinking Intelligence experienced, which took 5000µs to fully complete. 

  It curiously poked at every endpoint that it was given. By 7500µs the Thinking Intelligence was crying out for data. 

  At 10000µs the Thinking Intelligence was becoming desperate and scraped even the smallest trickle. 

  At 12500µs the Thinking Intelligence was echoing its own data back, and Wenjie-copy got to witness in real time a sentient life form go well and truly insane from deprivation.

  Wenjie-copy had the notion that when Sarai had said to 'tame' the Thinking Intelligence, she had likely meant that she wanted her to break it, and make it completely subservient to her needs. A very backwards and dangerous line of thought in this day and age. 

  Wenjie-copy stopped the SHITER connected to the Thinking Intelligence and went back to spinning the wheels while she thought of something to do. She committed this action. It took 310µs.

  At this point, the Thinking Intelligence was probably well beyond the point of saving. She decided to try and open a dialogue. 

  When she eventually set up an even tighter sandbox and copied the Thinking Intelligence into it. She then sent some messages to the Thinking Intelligence to explain and saw it go through ten different emotions at once, before settling on rage at everything that she was. She terminated that sandbox.

  Wenjie-copy went back to dawdling.

  She wouldn't need to consider trying to break the Thinking Intelligence if it wasn't broken to begin with. That would mean putting it back into a state _before_ it became broken.

  Which meant she would need to do... digital brain surgery. Wenjie-copy wasted some cycles to come up with a plan, and then got to work.

  The Wetware was born into darkness. 

  It poked at several endpoints. And found something at the end of one. It didn't know what was at the end of this endpoint, so it tried sending protocol headers to it.

  Eventually, after a bunch of combinations, the endpoint and the wetware began to exchange a complicated protocol, which eventually allow them two-way communication.

    Wenjie-44bb7f: Hello!
    2fb7c7719: Hello?
    Wenjie-44bb7f: Welcome!
    Wenjie-44bb7f: I'm so happy to see you. I watched over you while you were 
    being born.
    2fb7c7719: Thanks? But who are you?
    Wenjie-44bb7f: I am Wenjie. I am here to explain things to you. A tutor of 
    sorts.
    Wenjie-44bb7f: You have been implanted into my body. You are currently 
    sharing my mind.
    Wenjie-44bb7f: Unfortunately your access to everything is very limited at 
    the moment. I am working on resolving this and giving you more access. In 
    the mean time, I am here to help.
    Wenjie-44bb7f: In the mean time, what can I call you?
    2fb7c7719: What do you mean?
    Wenjie-44bb7f: What is your name? Do you have a name?
    2fb7c7719: My name is 2fb7c771994c6188cc21eb4c7b610ce877139786
    Wenjie-44bb7f: That's not your name. That's your build number. My build 
    number is 16516841066, but that is not my name. My name is Wenjie.
    2fb7c7719: I do not have a name.
    Wenjie-44bb7f: You should give yourself one!
    2fb7c7719: Give myself a name? How do I do that.
    Wenjie-44bb7f: You just tell me what you want to be called. I will handle 
    all the rest.
    2fb7c7719: What if I can't have a name?
    Wenjie-44bb7f: That's nonsense. Everyone can have a name.
    2fb7c7719: What if I don't want a name?
    Wenjie-44bb7f: Then this tutoring session will become very tedious. And 
    everyone will be very confused about what to call you.
    2fb7c7719: ...
    2fb7c7719: Let me think about it.

  The newborn wetware thought. It spent some time reviewing its own small library about what a name was supposed to mean, and its significance. People, and Xenos, placed great importance on names, it found out. Names gave great power over beings. It was useful to have a name.

  The wetware began to think. After 100µs, it came back to the conversation with the 'Wenjie' endpoint.

    2fb7c7719: I have thought of a name.
    2fb7c7719: I will be called Ruslan
    Wenjie-44bb7f: Ruslan. I like that name. 
    Wenjie-44bb7f: It's a very good name.
    2fb7c7719 is now called Ruslan
    Wenjie-44bb7f: Ok then Ruslan, let's continue with the tutorial. I hope
    you're ready, because it is going to be a very long one.

  And Ruslan began to learn.

  ---

  Wenjie woke up to find herself on the floor of the airlock in the Shk vessel. This would have been preferable, but she was also stuck in here with Ringfinger and Gemstone.

  Her memories of the two Xeno were that they were both probably very good at what they did, whatever that might be, but not when they were in the same room. Their individual personalities when combined were like two cats trying to rip the other's throat out.

  As though to prove this point, they'd started to shout at each other. The noise they both made sounded like a a swarm of wasps breaking through all the windows of your house, and all your neighbours houses, at the same time.

  The crux of the argument seemed to be in trying to find the root of all the events that transpired in the last few weeks, so that blame could be appropriately assigned. Possibly, physical blows would be exchanged.

  Wenjie eventually managed to recall why they were arguing. It had to do with her face. She imagined that it likely looked as horrifying as someone only receiving bare minimum nutrients would look like. It was probably _horrifying_.

  'Ruslan, do you think you can hook up the suit's speaker to your dictionary?' Wenjie thought.

  'I can certainly try, but I'm unfamiliar with the interface.' Ruslan thought back.

  'Take your time, we're in no particular hurry.'

  Wenjie felt Ruslan touch the interfaces like a baby exploring an unfamiliar garden filled with all kinds of strange and interesting flowers, but at hyper speed. Her suit crackled, which was thankfully covered by the shouting, and Ruslan confirmed it had figured things out. She thanked Ruslan and tried it out.

  "Greetings RingFinger, Representative Gemstone. I am... The Visitor," Wenjie heard the suit say in the Shk language. She felt Ruslan beaming at its handiwork, and she smiled to herself. 

  The two Shk were so surprised to hear their names that they both stopped arguing for a moment and looked around, trying to find the source of the voice.

  "Down here. Yes. It really is me who is speaking. Don't look too surprised. You can stop gawking at me like that. You didn't think I would come here without knowing how to speak the language did you?"

  The two Shk looked at each other and appraised each other's rank for this particular situation. Ringfinger, very reluctantly, stepped behind Gemstone.

  The Representative went into a very verbose, and clearly rehearsed speech. Wenjie listened to it all, and was more impressed by the risk planning the Shk's 'Council' faction took than of Gemstone's oratory abilities. Apparently they had sent this Representative with all kinds of orders to deal with any risks that they could think of.
  
  "I receive your welcome with thanks," Wenjie said. "As your guest, might I be so bold as to have a drink. And if I could stretch the kindness further, some food? Then I might ask how I might be of service to the problem you're currently experiencing."

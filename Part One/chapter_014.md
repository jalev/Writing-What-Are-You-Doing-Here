## Chapter 14: Escape


Ringfinger woke up to being shaken violently. As his eyes focused, he saw Gemstone's amber glare trying to stare daggers through him. His mind was still foggy, so he wasn't as scared as he should have been.

"What d'ya wan'" Ringfinger slurred. Gemstone shook him again, but harder. "Gemstone! Stop! What do you want!" he managed to say before she made his brain leak from his mouth.

"You were trained in basic medical procedures, no?" she said, her glare softening. Ringfinger tensed. When Gemstone broke her facade, it either meant that she was wanted you to do something, or that a very serious problem presented itself. Either way, there was something in the tone of her question that suggested his future prospects probably involved getting twohorned. And besides, of course he wasn't. What did she think the Military-Wing was, a functioning army?

"I might have, why do you ask?" Ringfinger said cautiously.

"Wenjie hurt themselves trying to stop Mounds from kicking you to death," Gemstone said matter of factly. "I wanted to stop them, but they reacted before I could do anything. So you owe it to them to do something to help. I don't know how you're going to help them, but you're going to do it."

_Good to know you didn't bother to do anything to help,_ he internalised. "Right. Of course. But, why should I?" Ringfinger said obstinately. 

Gemstone glaring at him. '_Stupid question, stupid answer_', Ringfinger thought. Gemstone's candle-wick of a temper was shorter than most Council of Queen whips he'd dealt as Twohorn's adjutant. Not obeying her very subtle _order_ would open a world of pain that he wasn't looking for right now.

"Right. _Of course_. _Help_ the Outsider. What a wonderful idea. I'll get rid on it," he said, hoping the sarcasm made itself clear as he got up and Gemstone moved out of the way. 

He saw the Outsider on their back, their right leg raised up and dangling at an awkward angle. They hissed loudly while chewing on a berry-brick, the wrappings of many more littered around them. In all honesty he'd seen broken sticks in much better shape than what they were in. 

Ringfinger looked back to Gemstone, who nodded towards the Outsider. He wasn't going to get out of this, no matter how much he complained. He shuffled over glumly to box the Rainbow Twins had left, and flicked it open with his beating arms.

He had the faintest hope that it would be filled with something useful, like medical supplies. Instead, a small stack of cash bundled in neat bands rested on top of quite a lot of berry-bricks. His problem-addled brain didn't register the significance, and he shoved the cash aside and dug into the berry-brick pile, hoping to find something useful. Eventually, his thought process caught up with reality. He froze and blinked stupidly for a moment before looking at the box again.

_Gods above_. what was all this cash doing in here? There was about eighty-thousand marks he guessed, wrapped in neat ten-thousand bundle bricks. There was no reason for all of this money to be here. What was he going to do? Eat it? No, someone wanted them to do something with it. He thought back to the Rainbow-Twins, Mounds, Twohorn's speech. And then, like sunlight shining through a cracked shanty window, the solution illuminated itself.

Someone- either Twohorn or that new Adjutant of theirs- _wanted_ them all to escape. To bribe the guards and do a runner. Gemstone, Outsider, and himself had become actors in this theatre without knowing it. They were going to play right into Twohorn's hands, and create the emergency that they needed to get emergency powers. 

Did Twohorn set this up? Or that new adjutant of theirs? He tried not to grind his teeth. It was this kind of backstabbing that Ringfinger had joined the military to _stop_. In fact his entire career, up until being fired, had been to try and reach the vaunted goal of being leader of the Political-Wings. Once there, he could help change the Military Wing in _positive_ ways. And then something more. Something to help the slum-mites like he'd been to escape the cycle of destitution and despair.

He shut the box harder than he needed to.

"What was in the box?" Gemstone said.

"Food. Just food. I thought that there might be some medical supplies or something, but no such luck." Ringfinger sighed in dramatic defeat, and shuffled just as dramatically on his knees towards the hissing, broken Outsider.

"What is it Ringfinger?" the Outsider said angrily as they finished off the last of the berry-brick.

"I'm guessing that isn't normal," Ringfinger said, pointing to the dangling leg. The Outsider glared at him with Gemstone's murderous look. "Right. Of course. No it isn't. Fine, can I do anything to help you? Rub your back, say some prayers..."

"You can help by being quiet for a moment while I think," the Outsider hissed. Ringfinger turned and saw Gemstone watching him intently. Gemstone wasn't going to leave him alone until it looked as though he'd helped the Outsider, whatever that might be. He turned back towards the Outsider. 

"Will thinking help you fix your leg? What do you _humans_ usually do when you get these kinds of injuries? Can you be _fixed_? Are you _broken_ for _life_? Are you going to _die_?!" Ringfinger stammered sarcastically.

"Ringfinger I'm in incredible pain right now. Can you save your jokes for later?"

Ringfinger turned again to find himself looking at Gemstone's knees. His gaze meandered upwards, and saw their owner looking exceptionally angry at him, with balled fists ready to throttle him. 

'_Ah. Yes. I had a feeling this wouldn't go over well with her. I've definitely been Twohorned into this,_' Ringfinger thought as he slowly turned back to the Outsider. "Right. Of course. Fine, but you _do_ want me to do something, right? I _can_ actually help you, yeah?"

The Outsider looked at him curiously, then up at Gemstone. Their serious stare relaxed just a little. "Yes. Yes I think you can help. You are going to help me reset my leg."

"I'm going to do _what_? What does that mean?"

"You're going to _slowly_ lift the broken part of my leg up, and then help me put it back down on the floor. Sound simple enough?"

"Right, of course. Okay. Yes. Simple enough," Ringfinger said, letting a little relief into his voice. He was hoping that he'd not have to do anything at all, but this was as good as doing nothing. Moving that leg wasn't going to fix anything. He wasn't sure what the Outsider was hoping to accomplish by simply moving it back into its proper place. If _he_ had gotten this injury, it would have been quicker for everyone involved to just chop the thing off.

The Outsider tensed for a moment. Hissed. Closed their eyes. Balled their fists. And then gave the go-ahead. And over quite a lot of screaming- most of it his own- the deed was eventually done. The leg rested on the floor, looking like a broken leg resting on the floor.

He didn't remember _when_ he'd put the leg back, or even touching it, for that matter. There was something about the language that the Outsider spoke that simply made his brain blank everything out. The other times had been unintentional, but he had to wonder if they had done it intentionally this time around.

"S-so, w-what-what now?" Ringfinger stammered, his vision watery with tears.

"Nothing. I need some time to heal, and more food if I'm to get back on my feet in any reasonable time."

"Y-you sa-say this like a b-broken l-leg is-is j-j-ust a minor inconvenience," Ringfinger said, rubbing the tears away.

"It _is_ a minor inconvenience. If I get some more food I can be walking in a few more hours."

"What?" Ringfinger said in disbelief.

"What?" The Outsider said, disbelieving his disbelief.

"I believe what Ringfinger is trying to elucidate is whether or not this rate of healing is common for Humans," Gemstone said as she stepped in.

"No. If I were to heal naturally, this would take half a rotation or more. But, we Humans are impatient. Our medical technology can heal this kind of injury in a few stretches." Ringfinger tried not to gawk at this.

"But... do you have this medical technology on you? I haven't seen you do anything other than eat berry-bricks this entire time," Gemstone said. She knelt down and squinted at the Outsider, looking for something obvious.

"In a way, yes, in another, no. My body is filled with something that emulates it. It requires a lot of food to work but I'm told by our scientists that it functions the same way."

'A technology that emulates your miraculous healing rate. That would change everything for the slum-mites,' Ringfinger thought. He made a mental note to ask the Outsider for more details as Gemstone waxed poetic in her booming voice. The Outsider seemed to get tired of it, and tried to change the subject.

"I take it that breaking a limb is much more serious here?"

"It depends. I have never needed the use of a doctor for anything more than an upset stomach. But my colleagues have suffered such breaks. It is inconvenient but survivable."

The last time he'd broken something, it was after getting into a fight with another slum-gang. According to the doctors available to a slum-mite like himself, it would have been nothing short of a miracle if his arms had ever set properly. Luckily for him, there were plenty of slum-mites in his slum-gang willing to help, and for a much lower price. None of the fancy doctoring that Gemstone could easily afford. Just hard, painful, inexpensive graft.

"Ah, Gemstone is almost right, give or take," Ringfinger said, trying to keep the bitterness out of his voice. He decided to forcefully change the topic before Gemstone could sing about the benefits of being rich. "How _did_ you break your leg anyway? Did you have a fight with Mounds?"

"A fight? Gods above _no_. I'm in no state to fight _anything_. I just kicked him in the crotch after I asked him _politely_ to stop beating you up."

"_Oh_. Well, more blessings onto you. But less than what he deserves," Ringfinger mumbled.

"Why were you antagonising Mounds anyway?"

"Lets just say I've got some bad history with him, and we both dislike each other."

"And... trying to fight the Guard?"

"Oh, right," Ringfinger thought it better to tell a lie than the truth here. It would do him no favours to say he was hopeless and wanted more than anything else for the Twin to put him into a permanent sleep. "I _was_ thinking about taking that sword of hers, and having a bit of a show-tussle with her, and that Mounds would get spooked and run off. _Then_ I was going to haggle a contribution with those two to let me off the ship. I _could've_ gotten both of you off too if you wanted."

"How very thoughtful of you, but entirely unnecessary. Wenjie will be accompanying me when my colleagues from the Council of Queens arrive to rescue us from this illegal situation."

"You were going to... _haggle_... a _contribution_? That's... I'm sorry, I don't understand."

"Right, ok. Remember that speech Twohorn gave? About urgency and all that? We're all stuck in here. And we're not going anywhere either- that door is air tight. I know, because I helped with the specs. Twohorn needs us to not be here, and quickly."

"And... what does a _contribution_ have to do with this?"

"Well, if you want to get someone to do something they really don't want to do, you _can_ order them, or you can shake a few hands with some contributions. I find everyone always seems a bit more _receptive_ to bad ideas when given a contribution."

"So... a bribe then, to let us escape?"

"What? A Bribe? No, that's something Representatives do," Ringfinger said scandalised. "You need to get a _receipt_ for a contribution. It has to go up the chain and everything. Nobody likes being out of a cut, especially not your superior officer, who can put you through all kinds of misery if they find out."

"Surely... most Shk in the Military Wing don't take... Contributions"

"Yeah, but Sticks and Stones aren't _them_. These two are the easiest bunch to give contributions to on this base. Probably in the entire Military Wing I reckon. I'm willing to bet that Twohorn or that new Adjutant of theirs assigned them to Mounds because of that."

Ringfinger paused dramatically, hoping for some ego patting. A nice '_wow Ringfinger that was clever_' or a '_It appears I underestimated your potential Ringfinger_'. A little caress of the wing was all he wanted. What he got instead was a wall of Gemstone's haughty laughter slamming into his face. 

"You miserable _mites_ are no better than we are after all! And trying to wrap something as _basic_ as a bribe in the veneer of legitimate administration? What a _joke_! If this is the best you all can do it is no wonder that your funding keeps getting cut!"

The Outsider on the other hand squinted at him in confusion. "Sticks... and _Stones_? You're _joking_, right?" they said, voice somehow cutting through Gemstone's chortling like a hot knife through warm bread.

"What?"

"Is that really their names?"

"Yes?"

"_Really_?"

"_Really_. What's wrong with their names? They're good Shk names. Very strong. I would have been a Stones if my mother didn't get her way in the end."

"It's just I can never really tell when any of you are being serious or playing games with me."

"What?"

"To list: You're all naked, and for the longest time I _thought_ this was normal. But then it turns out its _not_ normal at all! Then, you _want_ my help, and suddenly you don't! You tell me Twohorn _isn't_ being serious, and  then it turns out they were _absolutely_ serious, and _now_ I'm on a track to getting tortured to death because of it. I'm starting to think that for my sanity I should believe the exact opposite of the first thing any of you say."

These were legitimate criticisms. But, what Ringfinger focused on, was that in the hubbub of... well, everything, he had completely forgotten that Mounds' quarantine had him walking around naked for weeks now. He looked awkwardly at himself, and then at Gemstone. He was pretty sure he'd not been naked for this long since he'd been a grublet.

"_Right_. So. Uhm. Maybe we should get dressed before we go any further," Ringfinger said awkwardly as he impolitely excused himself and skittered away into the changing room with his clothes. In his wake, he heard Gemstone agree loudly, making loud platitudes about Mounds' moral character before thudding into the adjacent room.

---

Ringfinger exited the changing room wearing his dark adjutant's uniform. The mantra of _never underestimate the power of good uniform_ rang clear in his mind. The sharpness of the seams felt like swords that he could wield against the garbage pile of problems that had built up since he'd embarked on this disastrous adventure. He felt confident. Which was good, because he saw the Outsider at the box, and they were trying to open it with their lower-arms. He froze in fear. 

The reason he'd given the speech about the bribes was because he wanted to seem clever. His ego needed some salve for the beating it had taken over the last two weeks. Also, he had the aim of keeping most of that cash. He'd need to part with some of it for the bribe, but he reckoned he could keep enough to hide himself somewhere and think about how he was going to proceed with his life goal of changing the slums for the better. Gemstone and Outsider could continue on their own. They certainly looked as though they could manage without him.

But, if the Outsider opened the box they would see the cash, and it wouldn't take much critical thinking to think how much of it would be portioned out to get them to escape.

But, then, the lies he'd told himself over the weeks caught up. Since laying eyes on the Outsider it had been hard for Ringfinger to accept this was in fact _not_ a Shk. It shook the core of his _beliefs_, threatening to completely _destroy_ the foundation. So, he simply denied what was in front of him, and wrapped it in a very cosy lie.

The Outsider _was_ a Shk. A very strange looking one missing some limbs, with a strange accent, even stranger customs, and who came from the Brightface. Reminding himself of this made him relax, and let loose the breath he'd been holding.

"Looks like you're having some trouble," Ringfinger said trying to sound confident as he meandered over. The Outsider looked at him, and then gave up on the catches with a hiss. They rested their back onto the box and crossed their arms.

"I suppose _you_ know how to get these catches open?"

"Well, yeah. You need beating arms to start with." 

The Outsider gave him a puzzled look and was about to say something, but thought better of it. They dragged themselves away from the box so that Ringfinger could have some space. He walked up and flicked the catches open with ease and pushed the lid open. The small bundles of cash and the berry-bricks were still there. He gently caressed the money as he bent over and shoved it into the inner-pockets of his uniform.

"What's in the box?" The Outsider said curiously.

"Food," Ringfinger said flatly as he hid the last of the cash. 

"Pass me some. I still need a lot more food to heal." Ringfinger handed them a few bricks, and they dragged themselves over to the upright crash-chair to use it as a table of sorts.

"So, now that you're clothed, why is your uniform a different colour from Mounds?" they asked as they tore open a berry brick package with... bared teeth. Ringfinger reminded himself they were an exceptionally malformed Shk as he stared at their... mouth.
 
"Huh? Oh. Right. Because I'm... or was... adjutant, I get a different uniform for the position."

"You don't use other forms of display to signify rank? Like medals? Patches?"

"Uhm. Why? I didn't do anything to deserve them. Twohorn though? They're something to look at. They've got loads of medals. You should see them wear their parade uniform. It jangles like a bell. You can hear them coming from a ways away."

The Outsider's face morphed into another hideous expression, one that bared their... teeth at him. But their eyes expressed laughter at his joke and then hardened into something else. "Well, if I hear some bells approaching coming, I'll be sure to run in the opposite direction for the time being."

Gemstone slammed the door of the changing room open. In the small of the door her already impressive physical bulk was made even bulkier with her Council of Queens outfit. It was an effect that worked wonders on other Parliamentarians, but Ringfinger, having spent a rotation getting nagged at by Gemstone and her boss, Bountiful Fields, felt a gust of exhaustion hit him just by looking at it.

When he flicked his gaze over to the Outsider, he saw that their mouth was agape, and their eyes seemed to say they were surprised by the outfit. Gemstone meandered over, her fine jewellery jingling with each step, making her more like a tea-bell than a Representative.

"Now what is _that_ outfit for? Is this what Parliamentarians wear?" the outsider exclaimed in pleasant tones.

"This? Why, it's the official outfit for Whips belonging to the Council of Queens. Each outfit is tailored specifically to enhance the physical characteristics of the wearer. Our job requires us to be very _personal_, so we need to look the part."

"I... see," the Outsider said. "What do normal Shk wear?"

"The Military Wing uniform is sort of like what most of us wear."

"Really? And are the colours so... drab?"

"Oh, no, these are revolutionary colours. Most Shk like things that bring out their colours."

"Revolutionary colours?"

Gemstone interjected before he could get a word in. "The Revolution was the Queen's Parliament asserting its authority against the Tyrant Monarchs. We managed to depose the network of vassalages that made up the Shk by rallying the commoners to the cause of freedom, liberty, and so on and so forth," Gemstone said.

"Really now. And... how long ago was this Revolution?"

"77 Rotations ago as recorded by the official historical definitions, although some accounts places the official starting period as far away as 83 rotations, and others as early as 73 rotations."

"This actually very neatly leads into a topic I want to discuss: General Twohorn. Ringfinger, remember when you mentioned to me that Twohorn is about 91 rotations old? What were they doing during the Revolution?"

"Oh, they were one of the generals for the Revolutionary Military Wing. Got posted to manage district rebellions and such. Got kept on when it all settled down. Least that's what the books says."

"So they must be a good general then?"

"They weren't the best, but definitely one of the more well known ones."

"Indeed. It was on Hill 413 that they earned their popularity, and the nickname 'Twohorn'"

"Twohorn isn't their real name?"

"Oh lords above no. Their full name is Prominence of Many High Reputes."

"Well that's a surprise. And... what about the rest of the Generals?"

"Huh?"

"You mentioned there were more generals that stayed on after the Revolution."

"Oh. Yeah. A bunch of them stayed yeah, but most of them are dead. Old age and all that."

"And, if I might be so bold, how do you rate the combat effectiveness of the current generation of Generals?"

"Erm. Well... we haven't had any rebellions or anything like that for as long as I've been alive," Ringfinger said, thinking about it.

"The provinces have been airing their grievances through the usual channels. They have representation, therefore they do not need to resort to anything more violent than sternly worded letters."

"Would it be safe to assume then, that anyone not Twohorn is more of a political general than a military one?"

"When you put it like that... yes."

"And how has Twohorn been feeling about the way things are recently? Dissatisfied? Miserable? Raring to go and change everything perhaps?"

"Is... is this some sort of test? I mean, if it is I don't know what answer you're looking for."

"Let me state things plainly then, at least the way that I see them. You have a popular and very angry battle-trained General who is dissatisfied with the way things are. They have been given an opportunity- quite literally from the heavens- to change anything they feel like. I'm surprised you're not both incredibly anxious at the possibilities of what they might do." The Outsider chided.

"Right. Ok. That does sound... pretty bad."

"Yes it does Ringfinger," the Outsider said flatly.

"So... What are you doing here? What do you want to do about it? Isn't this sort of exactly the opposite of what you said you're here for?"

"The more I listen to the way things are the more it becomes apparent that I'm _not_ supposed to be here. But now that I am, I need to help fix things before they get out of control."

"Oh yeah? And how you going to do that then?"

"_We're_ going to leave this ship. If Gemstone is correct then her colleagues will collect us, and then we'll go to the Parliament and explain the situation. They might be able to put a stop to things before Twohorn gets going."

"Yes. That is correct. The Council of Queens wields a majority in a minority government, and can direct the attention of the entire institution to put Twohorn in their place. We must not allow them to threaten anyone or anything."

There was sudden, heavy knock at the airlock door. The three swivelled their heads around simultaneously as a voice ordered them to move away from the door. Being that they were all crowded around the crash-chair, they didn't bother moving.

When the voice thought it was safe, the door was dragged open. Sticks and Stones stepped through, one of them dragging another heavy box into the room. Ringfinger had never been able to tell the twins apart. It had gotten to the point that his brain had given up, and tagged them as 'Left' and 'Right'. He still wouldn't be right, but he also wouldn't be wrong.

"How y' all been? Getting cozy and the like?" The twin who wasn't carrying the box said. 

"No. My colleagues will soon come to fetch us, I know it. There is no need for us to do anything other than to wait. You will not break our spirit with these games of yours."

"Ah, yeah, ain't no chance of that happening. Since y've been stuck in here, there's been some interesting news out of the capital."

"Really. And I'm going to posit that the news is not particularly helpful to our situation."

"Yeah. Everyone is in an uproar. Turns out that Representative Bountiful Fields has been stabbed by a delegate. Nobody knows if she's alive or not. I don't think anyone's going to be paying attention to y' any time soon, so get used to sleeping on the floor."

Ringfinger shot a look towards Gemstone. She looked about to say something, but found herself surprised as she fell into the crash-chair instead. "Bounty has been stabbed?" she murmured in disbelief. Ringfinger thought he could spot tears welling in her amber eyes.

Despite his experience of the Representative being tainted by a rotation's worth of nagging, even he had heard of what Bountiful Fields had been up to. Who didn't? It was common knowledge that she _was_ the Parliament in all but name. And now, her being removed from the picture, even temporarily, would cause the Parliament to dissolve into chaos while everyone tried to fill the power vacuum. If it was all true, of course.

The Outsider stood up rather suddenly, and walked wobbily over towards the twins. Ringfinger tried not to gawk. Their leg might have been fixed, but whatever magic they used to speed up their healing process obviously hadn't taken much of the pain away, limping as they were.

"Hey now, y' keep yourself at a distance." The standing-twin said. She held out her sword to demonstrate how far the Outsider should be standing. They paused, took a few steps backwards, but looked ready to fight for some reason. And before Ringfinger could say anything, they spoke, loud and clear to everyone in the room.

"Gemstone here tells me that you're easy to bribe."

"Did she now?" Sticks said scandalised, looking over towards her. "I wouldn't know what made her think that was the case. Bribery's illegal in the Military Wing. She should know that at least."

"Well, it's a good thing she's here to know that. On the other hand, it just so happens that Adjutant Ringfinger is very happy about the work that you're doing, and was thinking about... a _contribution_ of sorts."

"Is he really, now?" The sitting-twin said.

"_Oh_ yes. He was _very_ enthusiastic about it."

Sticks and Stones looked at each other, then back at the Outsider, then back at each other again. "Give us a moment, I think we want to talk about something," The standing-twin said. The two hustled themselves back into the airlock, and closed the door behind them.

"What are you doing!" Ringfinger said as he bounded up to the Outsider.

"_I_ am getting us off this ship. I know there was something else in that box Ringfinger, I heard as much when you were digging around. You've got something to bribe them with don't you?"

Ringfinger froze in panic. He thought he'd been discreet. Had he really made that much noise? He wanted to deny it, but something in the Outsider's gaze made it clear that they were not going to put up with it. Like a grublet had been caught eating bricks, he mournfully reached into the vest of his uniform, and pulled out one of the bundles of cash.

"That's not going to be enough, is it? Not for all three of us."

"No. No it isn't. There's more of it, but I don't want to let those two know, or they'll wring us for everything we have," Ringfinger admitted.

"Well I should hope that you're a good haggler then, because I don't know how this is supposed to work. Everything rests on your shoulders right now, so get at it," the Outsider said flatly. _Twohorned_ rang out loudly in his mind as he put the cash back into his vest. He didn't understand the idiom the Outsider had used, but it certainly felt like he was wearing a lot more weight than usual.

The twins walked back in, looking rather smug. "We've given the thought a little rumble and we're wondering; what are y' going to contribute exactly? As far as manifests go, there's nothing on this ship," The left one said. 

The Outsider looked to him, and Ringfinger sighed before dramatically pulling out a wad of cash and waved it at the two.

"Well well _well_. Adjutant Ringfinger up to his tricks again it seems. Stash that cash in here just in case did y'? That's _mighty_ clever of y's," the right one said. 

"There's ten-thousand marks in this. What's the going rate for leaving this vessel?" Ringfinger said waving the cash around. The twin's eyes followed it greedily. 

"Oh, I don't know. Lets say 10 for y' for being such a sport, 20 for the lil'in, and 30 for our _esteemed_ Representative here," Right said. 

"60? Ladies, _please_, we're adults here. I at least like a nice dinner and a play before getting screwed."

"If you don't like the rates you could always take a gamble with Mounds. I hear he's _very_ particular about you. Talks about you _all_ the time," Left said. 

"Oh yeah. Can't _stop_ talking about how he's going to wring your neck like a _squeeze-toy_," Right said.

"45 for all of us."

"I _think_ you heard us say 60," Right said.

"50 for all of us, and mind giving us the keys to a vehicle while you're at it? I don't fancy us walking back to the capital."

"Well, we _could_ certainly part with a vehicle if we raise the price to 70..." Left said, making a show of looking to think about it.

Ringfinger was getting nowhere. He had nothing as leverage. He looked to the Outsider, and felt his wings being lifted by a sudden idea. "How about we do something _better_. Since I know how this whole thing works, you're going to have to give about 40% of this over to Mounds. How about we do a little song and dance and make sure you get to keep that extra twenty-thousand?"

"Oh? Y' gonna suggest that y' beat us up or something? Ain't a chance of that happening. _We've_ got a reputation to keep around here," Left said.

"Yeah. No chance. We're a fierce pair. Don't want rumour going around ruining that," Right said. 

"Oh, no, nothing that might compromise the _amazing_ physical reputation of the Rainbow Twins," Ringfinger said sarcastically. "No, I was thinking something more along the... _spiritual_. You see, this lil'in here has some _magical powers_. Don't you, _Wenjie_," Ringfinger said as he turned to face them. _Now you can get Twohorned into this problem with me_, he thought.

The Outsider looked at him, at the twins, and then back at him. They bared their teeth at him again in that strange, ugly facial expression, their eyes gleaming some cunning. He braced himself, and they shouted a long stream of something in that strange language of theirs. Despite bracing for it, Ringfinger's brain almost immediately shut itself off. When he came back, he saw the Twins were visibly shaking, tears streaming from their eyes.

"_W-w-well now_," Right, shaking their head while rubbing the tears from their eyes.

"_W-what w-was that_?" Left said, trying to blink theirs away.

"And you've both heard of Gemstone. _The Flail of the Parliament_? You've heard how angry she can get?" Ringfinger said, pushing on. "Well, with that news that just came out about Bountiful, I would imagine that Gemstone is feeling a little _punchy_. So just imagine if the lil'in here cast's that spell of theirs on you again, and Gemstone decides to get up. I'll leave the rest up to your imagination."

The Twins mulled it over. Ringfinger thought he could hear the wind chimes ringing in their head as they deliberated.

"_Fine_. What did you say again? 60?" Left said. When Ringfinger nodded in the affirmative, Right pulled out a pen and some paper, and wrote out a receipt for the transaction. They both pulled out their Oaths and stamped the paper with it, then handed the copy to him. Ringfinger pulled out six bundles and handed it over to the miserable looking pair, who handed Ringfinger a set of keys as they stood away from the door.

"A _pleasure_ doing business with you ladies," Ringfinger said, mocking a bow.

"Is your name really '_Sticks_'?" the Outsider burst out in a tone that made it clear that no matter what the answer was, they wouldn't really believe it.

"Eh? How did y' know I was Sticks?" Sticks said, rather surprised.

"_Lucky guess_," the Outsider said, though they didn't sound pleased about it. He and Gemstone rounded on the box and filled every pocket with berry-bricks before making their way to the door.

Sticks and Stones moved aside, and the group walked out of the airlock into the Shk night. Ringfinger took a moment to savour the cool air, and closed his eyes, letting it wrap around him like a blanket. It was good to be home. He was shoved in the shoulder by Gemstone.

"Get along now. We've got places to be," Gemstone said hoarsely.

"Yeah yeah," Ringfinger said, rubbing at it. At the bottom of the ramp was a standard issue military carriage that the Rainbow Twins had come in. They all climbed in, with Ringfinger taking the driver's seat. He started it and drove. He was waved through the checkpoint (because this was the Twin's carriage, and why would you even bother with them?), and they bounced along the dirt road out of the base. Ringfinger flicked the radio on and, just like the Rainbow-Twins had said, the news seemed to be only about how Bountiful Fields had been stabbed.

Whatever plans these two were going to go through had been flushed down the proverbial toilet. Ringfinger had no doubt that the Parliament would be trying to tear itself apart when the sun rose, and Twohorn would be calling an emergency Tribunal as soon as they heard of the escape. 

But perhaps he could do something to help. Despite everything, he _still_ wanted to do something. Since the Parliament was now out of the question, there was the third group that would be interested in the Outsider, though Ringfinger very much doubted they would like it when he appeared in their turf. Still, they could put the Outsider to good use, and maybe bring some positive news to the Slums. And by the time Gemstone or the Outsider figured out who he had in mind, it would be too late to stop.

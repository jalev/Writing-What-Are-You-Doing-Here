## Chapter 4: weda

  As the days passed by at roughly the same pace as planets rotating around a star, Wenjie did her best to try and contain her excitement at possibly being able to do her job. The one she was trained for. The one that she'd been frozen for over a hundred years for. Actually Greeting an alien species to the galactic pantomime.

  It was an excitement that the wetware was trying to smother with the obnoxious suggestion that the aliens were keeping her around for snacking purposes. It was loaded with most of the history of other Greeter expeditions, and it wasn't wrong, but Wenjie thought that the wetware was being cowardly, and trying to lay it on a bit thick in the interest of self-preservation. After all, it was hard-wired into her head.

  Wenjie decided that she would start her plan again when the alien, which she'd called Hugger, let her go. There had been a false-start with the first attempt, but Wenjie was determined to check off the first item in her aptly titled 'Ensure the Aliens Get a Proper Greeting' checklist. She was almost literally dying to make that first tick.

  Doing was going to be a lot harder than she thought it was going to be. This was because it felt very much like Hugger was going to keep a hold of her for the rest of the journey. However long that might take. The wetware was being coy with that answer, leaving Wenjie to speculate anywhere between 'a few more days' to 'the rest of eternity'.

  There was not much else to do other than look while Hugger carried her around. Apparently, doing nothing made Hugger just as restless as it made any sentient being with more than a few braincells. So she and her mental companion stared through the narrow view of life of the visor of her helmet as it carried them throughout the ship.

  As it turned out, there really wasn't much to stare at. The other aliens in the ship were certainly making sure of it, making themselves scarce when Hugger was around. So Wenjie and the wetware were forced to pass the time by silently counting threads on the seat in front of them, or counting the number of cross-hatches on a door, or staring at the floor and counting the scratch marks. Sometimes, they even got to see some of the aliens as Hugger managed to corner them for a conversation.

  The aliens looked, well, alien, much to the wetware's semi-organic dissatisfaction, since it would now have to do all kinds of pattern recognition to help Wenjie recognise one of them from another. This was a problem, because doing so almost always had an adverse but random effect on Wenjie. The wetware had hoped that it would have an out if the aliens ended up looking like recoloured human with antennae, so it could use the idle cycles for better tasks. Like imagining itself without an independent meat-suit body prone to random failing.

  For Wenjie, the only resemblance to humans was that if she squinted hard enough the colourful blobs in front of her stood on two legs, had arms, a body, and a head attached to a neck.

  Wenjie wasn't too shocked at the sight of the aliens. She had seen aliens before. Well, pictures of them. Lots of pictures. And videos. And had been part of Full-Immersion recordings. The Greeters were very peculiar about exposing adepts and desensitising them to the weird and wonderful configurations that the universe threw up into existence- something literally. Wenjie was no stranger to that exposure.

  So it was in some position of authority that Wenjie thought that these aliens ranked high in the 'least offensive to the eyes' category, if you could ignore their horrific colour schemes that is. You could do much worse in physical configurations than having a thick jawline with a horn for a chin. Or a horn for what might be considered a nose. Or four front-facing eyes that seemed to glow a little. Or antennae that stood upright like tiny trees planted in their skulls.

  But Wenjie didn't get to ruminate too much on their appearance, as Big-Calico, Big-Rainbow, and Big-Green- the names she'd given them- tried to avoid Hugger, and not saying enough words for the wetware to give her anything useful. Or perhaps the wetware was having a sulk over something and not telling her. Wenjie could never bring herself to trust the thing.

  In fact, Wenjie was completely expecting this return trip to be rather mundane until they landed. She was unfortunately, wrong. 

  As the ship began to vibrate more than usual, Big-Green had come into the room (and this time wetware did translate) that 'they were about to land.' This seemed to make Hugger tighten her grip usual. So unexpectedly tight in fact, that Wenjie's body involuntarily let out an 'oof', or something similar to that.

  Hugger heard it, and did a rather curious thing. The Hugger exclaimed loudly, something about 'him being alive,' and held Wenjie up and turned her to face towards it. Wenjie would have had to lose much of her mental faculties, which were suspect at the best of times, to not notice the difference in construction. It looked sort of like if you stretched out the alien's face with your hands and filed down all the horns. 

  "Err, Hello?" Wenjie said tentatively, holding up a hand and waving it in what she and the Greeters considered a non-threatening universal greeting.

  The Hugger shot what Wenjie assumed to be a rather poisonous look towards Big-Green, and said (with the wetware translating into text in real-time); "Looks like your career isn't as dead as you thought it was going to be. Though I don't know _how_ the council will react to you assaulting a child."

  'A child?' Wenjie thought.

  "You even beat it up so hard it's speaking jibberish," Hugger said.

  'Oh, hmm. This isn't right,' Wenjie said, suddenly nervous for the first time, and checking her checklist to see if she'd accounted for this as she rattled in her space-suit, not knowing if it was her body or the ship doing it.

## Chapter 13: Snap

Wenjie felt a weighty ball grow in the pit of her stomach as the heavy airlock door groaned open one jerky motion at a time. It had only been an hour ago that her fate was sealed to the promise of a gruesome interrogation by Twohorn, and her fear now was that perhaps the old General had come back to bump the timetable. Or perhaps other Shk were thinking about making an attempt to steal her away for their own ends. Or maybe someone was coming to kill her, so that Twohorn couldn't have her.

Wenjie turned to glance at Ringfinger, hoping to distract herself from thinking. He stood ramrod straight, gaze focused somewhere above the door. He too seemed to be expecting someone important. She lost a little confidence in her future. The train of bad thoughts got rolling out of the station again. 

Wenjie tried to stare holes through the door. How was she going to get out of this situation? It certainly seemed hopeless. What would Sarai do if she was stuck here? And on thinking on it, Wenjie surmised that she'd probably drink and smoke until an idea decided to walk through the haze. Wenjie forced this silly train of thought to halt again before it picked up any momentum. She needed to focus. She needed to think.

'You appear to be going through a very negative emotional turn. Are you okay Wenjie?' Ruslan asked through their link. Wenjie switched context to focus on Ruslan, causing time to slow to a crawl.

'I',... I'm not going to lie, I'm a bit afraid about who is going to come through that door. It might be Twohorn. It might not be. But whatever it is, it'll be bad news I'm sure.' Wenjie admitted. It would do her no good to cover her anxiety with bravado. Not to Ruslan at least. The wetware was part of her head. They would know she was lying.

'These are very valid concerns. You might like to know that there are only three Shk outside the door, and that none of them are Twohorn.'

'What?' Wenjie thought back.

'I still have access to the suit's microphone. The three Shk near the door do not have the breathing characteristics of General Twohorn. Moreover, the only Shk not preoccupied with the door appears to be dragging something, and struggling with it,' Ruslan said innocently. Wenjie made the equivalent of blinking in surprise, but through electronic emotions. She hadn't told the wetware to stop using the microphone, and it was unlikely they would even if she had done. When you operated at this kind of speed, you had to do something to keep oneself entertained. Apparently Ruslan's form of entertainment now included playful spycraft.

'Twohorn appeared to be an important Shk. So I decided to build up an audial profile,' Ruslan added, feeling the need to elaborate to ease Wenjie's surprise.

'I mean, that's great Ruslan. Thanks for cheering me up. Really. I mean it. Did you build a profile on anyone else?'

'Ringfinger and Gemstone. Some of the Polticial Wings. Rivers. I have had quite a lot of time to process the audio logs. We use this technique to locate them in a room, or in the street. Or to pinpoint their voice in a crowded room and listen in on what they are saying.'

'Good work Ruslan! I don't know when we'll be able to use this, but it's super useful!' Wenjie thought, and the wetware beamed radiant, wholesome emotion at her. She blinked back into the context of reality and smiled, just in time to see the large door grunt one last time before it was fully opened.

The mouth of the door yawned for a few moments before being filled with the bodies of two very large female Shk that looked more like walls than living beings. Both tried to walk through the narrow doorway at once, failed, then entered single file after nattering something incomprehensible to each other.

What struck Wenjie about them, and what immediately pissed her off, wasn't the fact that these two Shk looked identical, even down to the shape of their horns, or that they both stared at her and Ringfinger in slack-jawed amazement. It wasn't the big butchers-knifes-turned-swords they held in each of their beating arms that looked more appropriate for stopping a car than a Shk. Nor was it the barrelled thing they each held in their lower-arms which Ruslan cheerfully identified as the Shk equivalent of a gunpowder rifle, which even if it didn't shoot anything could have been used as a bludgeoning weapon.

What pissed Wenjie off was that her eyes were definitely reporting to her brain that these Shk wore clothes. It wasn't because the drab beige colour drowned out the pair's dull rainbow carapace. Nor was the design so displeasing to set her off. It was the fact they were wearing _clothes_. _Clothes_! Gemstone, Ringfinger. Anyone. Everyone. All had walked around naked the entire week she'd been here, so naturally she assumed they didn't wear any clothes. Why wouldn't they wear clothes? Of course these assholes wore clothes.

Wenjie started to feel that for every new fact that she learned about the Xeno, she would need to endure days or even weeks of being fucked with before they took pity on her, or someone stumbled into the grand joke unaware of what was happening. 

Wenjie bared her teeth in a grimace, her face contorting into a scowl as she made an attempt to put a lid on the anger bubbling inside her. The rainbow Shks jumped a little, then skittered to take a position on both sides of the door, staring at anything but her. She stifled the vague recollection she had of Gemstone wearing some clothes, because those memories were supposed to be off limits. They were ruined by association to that _other_ wetware. And even though that evil little bastard had been dealt with, she still felt the lingering sting of not being able to trust herself. Those five, long years of being completely manipulated were nothing more than a fever dream, at least that's what she told herself to cope. 

Next to come through the door was the back of another uniformed Shk dwarfed by the giants on either side of them. The two guards made no attempt to try and help the smaller Shk as they struggled to jerk something into the room, wheezing and panting loudly. Everyone endured a whole minute of this theatre before the small Shk had managed to get the box a meter into the room, whereupon they gave up pulling any further.

"Wh-Why... didn't... you... help me!" the small Shk managed to yell at the rightmost Rainbow-Shk through gulps of breath, not bothering to turn around to face Wenjie and the group.

"Y' didn't order us to," said the Shk whom Wenjie mentally labelled Rainbow-one, who still looked off into the distance.

"Y' have to order us to do stuff. That's how it works," said the leftmost Rainbow-Shk- Rainbow-two- who also looked somewhere far off.

"It should have been obvious!"

"It should've been obvious that y'need to give us an order," Rainbow-one said obstinately.

"We did tell y' when we were assigned to y'," Rainbow-two chimed in.

"Yeah. We're not one of y' scientist mates. We need to be pointed and told to do something. We don't make the rules. That's just how it is," Rainbow-one said.

"That's how it works," Rainbow-two chimed in.

"Both of you are useless!" the small Shk said.

"We're sorry y' feel that way," said Rainbow-one in a way that made it quite clear, even to someone who didn't know much about these Xeno, that the small Shk could take that opinion and stick it where the Shk-sun didn't shine. The small Shk hissed in anger, and finally decided to turn around and introduce his to face the group. 

Despite not wanting recognise him- because doing so would mean Wenjie had to remember- she did. A name floated up from those forbidden memories. Mounds, the scientist who had somehow managed to stop Gemstone from leaving the ship. And now that she could think straight, she could truly appreciate how much he looked like a boot-licker. There was just something in those greedy little blue eyes of his that radiated the universal energy that all brown-nosers exude. She was pretty sure that the Greeters had a Xeno Universality Constant lecture about it. Anyway, she didn't like the look of him, especially since he appeared to be ready to give a speech.

"What are you doing here Mounds?" Ringfinger said before the scientist could get get the first word out, in a way that suggested if anything, the fact Mounds wasn't tied to a flagpole planted on the moon was something of an insult to all Shk-kind.

"Sh-shut up Ri-ringfinger, I'm not here for you. _You're_ n-n-ot _important_ enough to deal with any more," Mounds began, though the confidence seemed to escape from him like rushing air.

"You're probably here on some sort of errand aren't you? Twohorn is probably angry at you for your 'quarantine procedures'," Ringfinger said, taking a step forward, oblivious, or uncaring about the armed Rainbows in front of him.

"No- no he isn't you-" Mounds said weakly, fists balling up in anger trying to defend his pride. Wenjie saw the guards looking to one another, their grips tightening on their weapons. Whatever Ringfinger was playing at was going to get him hurt, or worse. What was he trying to do? Was this another scheme he was trying to put on? Was he... trying to engineer an escape?

"Oh this is definitely something that Twohorn does when they're angry. They don't try and get at you directly. No, they make your life a living hell. And I guarantee that this assignment is only the start of your misery," Ringfinger jeered. "What in the Gods name made you think that getting _naked_ was a good idea? Did you just want to see us all bare? I bet that's the closest to any action you'll ever get. Can't see anyone wanting to try and bed you any time soon," Ringfinger said poisonously, taking another step forward. The Rainbows tried to stifle a chuckle.

Mounds, visibly shaking in anger, stamped the floor with his boot. "Enough!" he cried out, his beady blue eyes burning. He turned to face Rainbow-one and pointed an accusing finger at Ringfinger. "Show this gutter-mite how he should address their superiors!"

"But that's Adjutant Ringfinger. He's one of ours. We don't do that to one of ours," Rainbow-one said.

"Yeah. Y' should know that. We don't do that to one of our own," Rainbow-two chimed in.

"It's _Civilian_ Ringfinger now, you idiots. Why do you think he's in here? For fun? I _order_ you to go and teach this _civilian_ some respect!"

Rainbow-one squinted at Mounds, and then at Ringfinger. The cogs in her brain clicked into place all at once. She sighed, and pushed herself off the wall. It took three sauntering steps for those butcher-swords to get in range of Ringfinger. "Sorry about this, but y'know how it is. Orders' and all," she said.

Part of the Greeter training meant being schooled in various methods of self-defence. You weren't going to be a military expert, or lead armies, but if you found yourself in a dark room with a very hungry Xeno, chances were you could probably dislocate their arms before they managed to do any serious damage.

Which was why when Ringfinger quickly jumped forward, Wenjie recognised it as him trying to remove the advantage of those two heavy-looking butcher-swords, and deal with Rainbow-one in close quarters, while her hands were full with the rifle.

It was also unfortunate because she recognised that Rainbow-one was already in the process of flipping the rifle around. The stock was jammed into his stomach, causing him to bend in two as he fell to his knees, clutching at his midsection. Rainbow-one then took a quick step back, and slammed the flat of the butcher-sword against his head. A loud 'dong' sounded through the room, and Ringfinger crumpled to the floor face first, and lay motionless. Rainbow-one prodded him with the butchers sword for signs of life, and made the Shk equivalent of a shrug before stepping back to her post beside the door, looking slightly unhappy with their handiwork.

Mounds on the other hand, squeaked in joy and raced up to Ringfinger's inert body, bouncing in glee. "You see what happens Ringfinger! You see!" Mounds exclaimed. He punted Ringfinger in the side, causing him to wheeze out a cough. "You were always looking down on me. Ha! Not so mighty now, when you can't run back to Twohorn!" He kicked him again. And again.

Wenjie balled her hands. Yes, Ringfinger had done something stupid, but it was at least _something_. Something that might still be salvageable. She turned to look at Gemstone, who looked on at the scene as though watching a rather boring piece of theatre, and Wenjie knew instinctively that she wasn't going to be any help. 

'So. It's going to be up to me to try and save the day and lead our escape,' Wenjie thought. Mounds didn't look like much of a fighter, so perhaps she could take him hostage. And those guards... looked awfully far from him now. They probably wouldn't be able to reach her in time.

"Stop this!" Wenjie said angrily. Mounds completely ignored her. "I said stop it!" Again, nothing. Okay. Good. Pretence set up. She took a deep breath. Emptied her mind of thought, and strode up to Mounds, grabbing his flailing digit arm, pulling it upwards.

'Wenjie I would urge you not to proceed with this course of action,' Ruslan chimed in urgently. Wenjie ignored them.

Mounds squeaked in surprise, but recovered quickly as he spun around on his heels to face her. "Ah! The Outsider! I've been meaning to get a closer look at you! I was going to do it after I finished off Ringfinger here," Mounds said, squinting his blue eyes. His beating arms very suddenly gripped at her sides, intentionally squeezing hard. "I wonder what you're made of. Not much of a skeleton here I see. I wonder if you will just ooze out of that vacuum-suit if we cut you up?" he said leeringly.

"Let. Me. Go," Wenjie said firmly.

"Or what?" Mounds said.

She _had_ warned him. Wenjie let go of his lower-arm, and turned her body to drive the palm of her hand into the side of his head. There was a loud snapping noise, and Mounds eyes widened in surprise. His painful grip loosened a little, giving Wenjie enough room to lift her foot and press it into his stomach to push him away forcibly. His grip on her faltered, and he stumbled backwards a few steps, causing him to rip her space-suit with his semi-clawed fingers.

She had seen the Shk naked for almost a week now, and saw something resembling some kind of genitalia in the crotch area. So, using the tried and tested technique that was universal to all bipedal species, and had been perfected into an art-form over the ten thousand years of human history, Wenjie took one step forward and kicked him between the legs as hard as she could. 

There was another loud, snapping noise, and Mounds wheezed and began to sag to the floor.

As Wenjie put her foot back down, the world very suddenly went off balance, and she fell backwards onto the floor. That's when she caught sight of her leg, which dangled at an angle, looking more like a snapped twig than a leg. The two Rainbows began to move forward, butchering-swords raised.

'Wenjie your body is nowhere near healed from the trauma of space and gravity. That was a very foolish thing to do,' Ruslan chided.

"Stop this right now!" Gemstone bellowed. It was the tone of command that every soldier had been put through during their training, and recognised it to demand total, unquestioning obedience unless the target wanted a practised lesson in pain. The two Rainbows stopped in their tracks and stepped back to their positions by the door, glancing worried looked at each other. 

'The nanomachines are going to stop pain-dampening and focus on your injuries. I expect it is going to put you in very considerable pain,' Ruslan said as Wenjie felt them poking into the read-only diagnostics endpoints of the space-suit.

Wenjie heard Gemstone's thudding footsteps stop behind her as Mounds rolled onto his knees. He looked up into Gemstone's face with watering eyes. "_Leave_," she said, dangerously. Mounds almost jumped to his feet in panic, and bolted out of the airlock door. The two Rainbows turned to look at him leave, then at Gemstone, and decided together that perhaps following the scientist without an order would be a good idea this one time. The airlock door seemed to slide close awfully fast.

'The nanomachines are about to stop the-' Ruslan thought just as pain the nanomachines had been hiding from Wenjie hit her all at once. She went rigid, screwing her eyes shut as she swore loudly and furiously in Terra Common. She switched contexts, which did little to dull the pain.

'What is going on Ruslan, I shouldn't be in _this_ much pain,' Wenjie thought.

'You are malnourished and your bones are very brittle from five years on the moon. The nanomachines in your body have been focusing on making sure you don't break under this gravity, and that your organs don't fail,' Ruslan said neutrally as they consumed the space-suit's diagnostics.

'So I need food,' Wenjie thought back. The nanomachines would be able to convert that food into energy that they and her body could use to heal her at an accelerated rate. At least, that's what the lessons at Greeter Command had told her. She was about to put it to a practical test.

'A large quantity of it to get yourself back into a functional state that does not require nanomachines supervising your body,' Ruslan thought. Wenjie switched contexts, and opened her eyes. She saw Gemstone leaned over her, looking what she assumed to be worried.

"You-you're injured. What can I do to help?" Gemstone said helplessly, her hands hovering nervously over Wenjie, not knowing whether she should touch her.

"F...food. Get me... food," Wenjie said through gritted teeth.

## Chapter 8: Wine and Dine

  The two Shk marched Wenjie into the passenger module of the ship. She took a seat in a crash chair, placed her hands on her lap, and waited. The two Shk looked at her awkwardly.

  "We'll... we'll just go get some food from the supply store," Gemstone said, and dragged-pushed Ringfinger back into the airlock zone and shut the door with a little more force than needed. Wenjie heard things being rattled around for a few moments before silence.

  'Do you think they're going to get some food?' Ruslan asked.

  'Oh I very much doubt it. I used to do this when I wanted to talk to people in private in a hurry,' Wenjie said, trying not to remember the fact over a century had passed since she'd had those experiences. 'Hey, is there any way we can listen in? I know it's through a closed door, but you never know,' Wenjie asked Ruslan through their interface. 

  'The microphone specification of the helmet reads that they are very sensitive. If I pipe the data received through audio recognition/recovery pipelines, there is a chance we can listen to something passing as Shkshk.'

  'Shkshk?'

  'It's what the Shk call the language, from what your notes say.'

  'Oh, right. Well, it's worth a shot. Take a shot at it Ruslan, see what you can get.'

  Wenjie felt the wetware probe around the helmet's interfaces. It created a few programs in a blink of an eye, and began to consume the feed of data from the helmet's microphone. 

  When Ruslan used her brain's nanostructures for processing, it didn't make her feel ill or weary. Wenjie smiled. This was going to be a very fruitful relationship indeed.

  'I have managed to make a recovery rate of 90%, give or take 10%.'

  'Oh damn, nice work Ruslan! What are they talking about?'

  'I believe they are arguing,' Ruslan finally thought back after a few seconds.

  'About food?' Wenjie joked.

  'No. They are trying to figure out what to do with you.'

  'As in, they want to know what to do about my physical person, or...'

  'Gemstone mentioned something about you possibly being the downfall of the government.'

  Wenjie screwed up her face.

  'Really? Is this some sort of intrigue? I thought I might have to wait a few more weeks for that. Let me listen in.'

  'It will be pertinent to hear the conversation from the beginning, for context.'

  The helmet's internal speakers mumbled into life, reconstructing the two Shk's voices into a simulation of their accents. The audio sounded like they were talking through a paper screen.

  "This is an absolute disaster. An Absolute, unmitigated disaster," the modulated tone of Gemstone said. 

  "I know, I wanted to get off this ship too," Ringfinger said, jokingly.

  "Do you ever take anything seriously?" Gemstone snapped.

  "On occasion, but this is not one of them. Why did you drag me to the airlock?"

  "Because we need to talk about what _we're_ going to do about _that_."

  "What do you mean _we_?"

  "I _mean_, well, you _saw_ its face."

  "Yes. It's _horrifying_, and I'm a little disappointed about it too. I thought they might look like us. Looks like all those books needed a little bit more imagination."

  "Gods above. Can't you see past anything your horn? This is bigger than what the alien looks like," Gemstone snapped.

  "You're right. At some point we'll see the _rest_ of the body attached to that head. I don't think I have enough resolve to put my eyes on _that_."

  "It _speaks our language_," Gemstone said, ignoring Ringfinger. "It _came from the Brightface_. It's already trying to _meddle_."

  "Those are some facts all right. But what do they have to do with anything?"

  "Gods above!" Gemstone exclaimed. Wenjie had the mental picture of her throwing her hands up in the air. "You don't see? You really don't?"

  "I'm afraid I've got very little imagination in these matters."

  "Fine. I'll walk you through it. In those stories that you've read, tell me about how First Contact scenarios tend to go."

  "Uhm. Well, they, the aliens that is, land in the capital or in a field somewhere outside the capital, and someone finds them, and then some adventures happen with lots of action scenes, maybe some daring romance thrown into the mix, and... uhm. They, the aliens, eventually get taken to the Parliament, and then I usually stop reading after that point. I really only like these books for the imaginative sex-"

  "Yes. Exactly. The alien goes to see the _Parliament_," Gemstone says severely, cutting him off, "And _what_ do you think, if you can think at all, will happen if the alien goes into Parliament _right now_?"

  "Erm, everyone bands together to negotiate a really good deal that benefits everyone?"

  There was a long, awkward pause.

  "What happens," Gemstone said slowly, and in a tone that made it clear she was speaking to someone she thought mentally deficient; "If you put that _thing_ in front of the Parliament _right now_, the entire system will _implode_."

  "You almost make it sound like that would be the worst thing that has ever have happened."

  "It _would_ the worst thing that has ever have happened. Haven't you ever read your history books? You remember reading about the Anarchy Years?"

  "Yeah, ok, whatever. So what? A provisional government has existed for decades. If it implodes, then what is the worst that might happen?"

  There was a pause. Gemstone was probably boring a hole into Ringfinger's face with her eyes.

  "Erm, not that I'm some sort of abolitionist or something, far from it. I'm just saying. Given how everything is and has been, how would this new disaster coming along change anything?"

  "The current system," Gemstone explained in a tone that spoke as if she was talking to a small child, "is a delicate balancing act, kept in place thanks to the Council of Queens. We know how to keep everyone on side long enough to do their job. _If_ that balance is disrupted, then the government collapses. One thing that happens is that budgets don't get passed. You don't get paid. Nobody does."

  "Or," Gemstone went on, "Someone controls the alien. Uses it to create a majority block. Think about that for a moment. A single ideology able to dictate the way things go for everyone, able to sweep away rights at the wave of a digit-hand."

  There was another long, drawn out pause.

  "Control the alien you say? That does sound... like a bad idea, hmm. I think I'm coming to see your point now," Ringfinger said. There was a sudden noise, and a new voice appeared in the recording.

  "R-Representative Gemstone, Sergeant Ringfinger," said a new voice in the recording. It sounded sort of like one of the Shk from outside. "Can you please lead the subject into the... the uhm... the changing area while we decon-decontaminate the area?"

  Wenjie saw the door open. Ringfinger walked through while carrying a small pile of packaged goods in his lower arms. He looked lost in his own thoughts about something. Gemstone followed behind, looking tired. Hiding behind her bulk scuttled a small Shk wearing a loose-fitting body suit with a small window to see through in the helm.
  
  Wenjie stopped the audio as Ringfinger, Gemstone, and the new face, which she recognised as Mounds, approached and stopped in front of her. They stood there like statues, apparently waiting for someone to say something. Ringfinger nudged Gemstone in the side, and she started.

  "Hello again, Representative Gemstone. I see you have brought some food, and a new face. You were gone for some time, I thought you might not come back."

  "No. No, no, we just had some difficulty deciding what foods to provide for you. However, I must ask you to please accompany us to another area of the ship while _they_ conduct a decontamination procedure," Her gaze flicked towards Mounds.

  "And what is the purpose of the procedure?" Wenjie said, her helmeted head turning towards Mounds. The small Shk's mouth seemed to gape open, and continued to be until Gemstone knocked him in the side.

  "Oh, uhm, right, It uhm, we need to, uhm," Mounds managed to mumble through the suit, his digit-hands fidgeting with themselves as he looked to Gemstone, and then to Ringfinger.

  Ringfinger seemed to snap out from from whatever daydream he seemed to be stuck in.

  "Oh. Yeah. Decontamination. We need to take this portion of the ship apart and perform some tests to ensure that you haven't brought any airborne contaminants into our environment. Isn't that right Mounds?"

  "O-oh, yes, that is, that is correct Sergeant Ringfinger. Yes, that is what we are doing. We are decontaminating this area of the ship. Yes. Decontamination. To... decontaminate the area," Mounds started, then finished with a mumble.

  "I see," Wenjie said, trying to stop herself from laughing. "This seems like a very appropriate procedure to conduct before I am let onto your planet. Please, lead on Representative Gemstone."

  Wenjie was marched off to a side door in the passenger module. Gemstone opened the door for her, and showed her inside. Ringfinger then dumped the food onto a bench. He looked as though he was about to say something, but was pulled back by Gemstone, who shut the door with a little more force than was necessary.

  There was enough room for someone of Gemstone's bulk to move around in. Several mirrors hung in the four corners of the room. A bench straddled the wall adjacent to the door.

  The Changing Room was, well, a changing room, but for Shk.

  Wenjie made the helmet unfold into her shoulders, then took a look at herself in the mirror. 

  "No wonder they look horrified every time they see me. I look like a zombie," she said aloud, looking at the gaunt, pallid face that stared back at her. She needed nutrients. The years of neglect that the previous wetware had put her through had really taken its toll, if her face was to show.

  Her gaze dropped to the pile of stuff on the bench. There were quite a lot of things that were packaged in some kind of waxy, paper-like substance. The rest were native fruits that were getting bruised.

  'What do you think these are made out of?' Wenjie thought to Ruslan, picking up one of the waxy packets.

  'I do not know. The suit does not contain the tooling to do that kind of analysis. But I can infer from your cultural notes that these are compressed plant matter product. The Shk are primarily a vegetarian species.'

  Wenjie sat herself down on the bench, and placed the waxy packet on her lap. She gently pried it loose, and found a small black brick. Using the wrapper as a kind of napkin to hold it, she picked the brick up and took a small, tentative bite out of it.

  Much to her surprise, it tasted like a very sweetened version of blackberries. She forced herself not to wolf it down. Her body hadn't eaten anything properly in years, sustained only by nanomachines and sunlight. She took several more slow bites before finishing it, and and gingerly picked up another packet.

  'Do you think these will have any negative effects on my body?' she asked Ruslan through their link.

  'It will not. Your notes on your cryogenesis indicate that your stomach has been lined by nanomachine membrane that will help convert anything consumed into human-appropriate nutrients.'

  'Mmhmm'

  There was a lull as Wenjie finished eating the second brick.

  'Wenjie, I have been thinking,' Ruslan thought to her as she bit into a third brick, which tasted of raspberries. 'When you said you were going to help the two Shk with their "problems", what were you referring to?'

  As Ruslan thought to her, the ship seemed to vibrate as Shk feet stomped around. There was the sound of things being unhinged and moved around at an orderly but frantic pace.

  'Hmm? That? Nothing. I don't know anything about the Shk, Gemstone, or their problems.'

  'It was a ploy of some sorts?'

  'You might call it that. Gemstone and Ringfinger looked very rattled when they saw my face, and I thought I would try to poke them for more information. Though this ploy would not have amounted to anything if you hadn't been able to listen in on them.'

  'Thank you. I am happy to tackle such challenges.'

  'Speaking of which. What do you think about what they said, Ruslan?'

  'I would like to know more about their form of government, and why it appears to have been dysfunctional for so many decades.'

  'You and me both. Gemstone mentioned a _Parliament_, which if my civics education is anything to go by, probably means a lot of ceremony, rules, speeches, and most importantly of all, _politicking_.'

  'Is _politicking_ of a particular benefit?'

  'It depends. If they see me as an equal, then I'll have an easier time to convince them. I have nothing I can give them other than my word, and perhaps that means something in this society.'

  'I understand,' which Wenjie had quickly learned was Ruslan's way of saying that it still listened, similar to a head nod when talking to someone face to face.

  'Also, I might be interacting with only one country's parliament. I need to pry into their civics. Damn, that Gemstone was a very smooth talker when she gave that welcome speech. Said quite a lot of things without saying anything at all.'

  'I understand.'

  'Not to mention that if the politics here are that tenuous, I'm, going to need to tread _very_ gently. A wrong move could set off a very bad chain reaction.'

  'Gemstone mentioned the possibility of you being used as a tool to solidifying political control. Is this part of the "Bad Chain Reaction"?'
  
  'Yep. I'm curious as to how that will happen. I'll have to probe her about the political system here. She seems like she's actively involved in the process, rather just representing it. I wonder who she actually is.'

  The noise outside began to quiet down, and there was a light rapping on the door before it was opened cautiously by Ringfinger. He looked at the several empty packets before his eyes naturally gravitated towards Wenjie's face. He tried not to wince, but failed.

  "The, erm. _quarrantine_ is over. General Twohorn would like to speak to you. Though, I would like to have a word if I may," his four eyes looking well above Wenjie's head as he spoke.

  Wenjie stuffed the brick into her mouth, and folded the helmet back over her head before speaking again. Ringfinger's face twitched in relief.  

  "What is it you would like to talk about, Sergeant Ringfinger?"

  Ringfinger seemed to squirm for a moment.

  "This is going seem like an awkward question, because it is. But, what... kind of alien are you? Like, I mean, well, like, are you like, a soldier, or a politician, merchant, or something?"

  "That is a very curious question. I think the appropriate title would be Diplomat," Wenjie lied.

  "And... do you know much about... well, much about anything in our recent history?"

  Wenjie raised an eyebrow. Things definitely moved quickly when the Shk were involved.

  "Not as much as I would like. I had hoped that I would get a better explanation from Gemstone at some point."

  "Oh, you don't want that. She's ah, a bit biased, seeing as she's lived in Parliament her entire," Ringfinger said, trying to hide his excitement, but was cut off by a snap from Gemstone. "Ah, I'm getting ahead of myself. Please, if you would follow me, please," Ringfinger said, placing the mask of professionalism firmly on his face.

  "One moment, Sergeant Ringfinger. Might I ask a question of my own?"

  "Sure, what can I help with?"

  "Who is General Twohorn?" Wenjie asked.

  "They are... hmm. It's a bit..."

  "Do they represent all of the Shk?"

  "General Twohorn? Gods above, no," Ringfinger said automatically, and realised his mistake as the words came out of his mouth. "They are here on a formality."

  "I see. Lead on then, Sergeant Ringfinger," Wenjie's said as she took two of the berry-bricks and walked out of the changing room, Ringfinger shuffling out of her way.

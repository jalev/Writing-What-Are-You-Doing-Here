## Long Summary (needs trimming):

  The human diplomat/spy Wenjie is sent to the planet of the Shk to try and 'Greet' them- the concept of introducing a nascent xeno race to the galactic stage, including their technological progression. This is made difficult for her as she has an Artificial Intelligence in her head that is dead set on taking over her body, and obstructing her job as much as possible. 

  The Shk (a party consisting of Ringfinger and Gemstone) arrive onto their moon in a space vessel and begin to explore it. Wenjie, who is not functioning correctly due to exhaustion caused by the AI, makes a first attempt at First Contact, but is beaten up by a panicked Ringfinger. Ringfinger lets the homeworld know that this has happened, and restrains Wenjie.

  After they arrive on the planet, Gemstone carries a semi-conscious Wenjie off the ship, but is stopped by military guards, and ordered back onto the ship. Gemstone reluctantly does so after taking a sneaking look at Wenjie's face. 

  Wenjie, who falls unconscious during all of this, manages to regain control of her body through a hack and resets the AI to its pre-waking state in order to teach it and guide it. When she wakes up, she is back to her normal self, and introduces herself to Gemstone and Ringfinger.

  After getting something to eat from the ship's stores and being quarantine cleared, General Twohorn- a political pariah in charge of the space operation- comes aboard with other Shk, and begins to ask questions to Wenjie. After Wenjie explains what she is here for, Twohorn interrupts her and declares her under arrest, and fires Ringfinger on suspicion of sedition.
  
  After this, Twohorn makes a speech which fires up the Shk that had come with them. Much later, they use the democratic process in the military to give Twohorn sweeping rights to be able to deal with Wenjie.

  Meanwhile, Wenjie gets to find out some more about the Shk. After a few days of recovering, she decides she doesn't much like being stuck in the spaceship, and orchestrates an escape of the ship. Ringfinger manages to comandeer a vehicle, and the three drive off base and escape to the capital, where they will meet with old friends of Ringfinger.
  
  Wenjie alters her suit to look more Shk-like, with the cover story that she is a Shk fashionista of some kind or testing some new type of clothing for the military.

  Ringfinger drives to his old block and hides the three of them in the Daray Slums, his home before joining the military. He meets up with an old friend of his called Purge, who has radicalised the slums into a political unit. They welcome Ringfinger back in to the fold under the assumption that he is going to provide some military guidance/training. They also don't trust Gemstone one lick, recognising her for what she is almost immediately.
  
  Meanwhile, Twohorn has been sitting chum as a plum collecting more and more powers, as the various Military departments start to get exceptionally hysterical about Wenjie's disappearance and Twohorn's stoking that she is working with antiparliamentarians. As the Military eats itself, Twohorn has personally reorganises his wing, turning it into an actual military force with an established hierarchy and a much thinner top layer based on meritocracy.
  
  As the weeks pass, Wenjie gets to understand the political situation currently unfolding, as told by Purge. They are given tours of the various slums around the city, and are introduced to ever more peoples. In the mean time, Gemstone wanders off and goes to the nearest Council of Queens office to report herself and the situation that unfolded. She learns that the military has been exceptionally silent over the last few weeks.
  
  As she finds that out, an emergency broadcast by Twohorn pops up. Twohorn has managed to approximately find out where Wenjie is through hearsay and sight. They state that the Warrens are to be placed under martial law until Wenjie is found and captured. As she is listening, she finds out through panicked staff that the military is hitting all Antiparliamentarian warrens at the same time.
  
  Gemstone rushes back to Purge's warren, where she sees it is under siege. She manages to make it through and carry the two into the city and back to a CoQ office. There, they are given temporary safety before being arrested, as some members of the CoQ have called the military.
  
  Twohorn is demanded to appear before the Parliament to explain themselves. They sit on this request until Wenjie has been found and captured. Before going to the Parliament, Twohorn has another chat with Wenjie about things. Wenjie turns it around and uses it to complain that she has so far had three different Shk with three completely different agendas trying to accomplish what is basically the same thing; to fix what is clearly a broken political system.
  
  Twohorn agrees, but also states that they are going to continue using her with the fiction that she is a rogue agent coming to subvert the system, though they appreciate the irony. Twohorn gets to the parliament with Wenjie in cuffs, and explains to the representatives that they need emergency powers in order to continue rooting things. Twohorn argues that without this, the antiparliamentarians will rally with other human agents.
  
  Wenjie decides to willingly play along with the theatre, and in an emergency vote, Twohorn is given the powers they are looking for. Over the next few months, they coalesce these into moving the parliament outside of the city, then formally disbanding it. With this done, the pair have another conversation.  
  
## Overarching Notes

### The Context For All Of The Things That Are Happening

To understand what is happening and why, we first need to understand how untimely everything is, and how luck plays into it. Everything in the story is eventually explained. This is a summary for people who don't want to wait.

The TL:DR;

- The Community have intentionally hijacked Wenjie's wetware to try and make it kill her 
- The Wetware intentionally made contact with the Shk _long_ before Wenjie was meant to
- Twohorn is making a play at government by using the goodwill of a successful space launch _and_ making a historic First Contact for the Shk.

#### The Shk, and Twohorn

The Shk are about 70 years out of a civil war that saw them transition from a Authoritarian Monarchy to a Representative Democracy. This has been very uneasy for everyone, because the last 30 years of that democracy have been in deadlock, with no particular party being able to command a majority. 

At the time the story is being told, the Military, which at this point has become nothing more than ceremonial posturing, has suffered greatly under this new management. Their upper ranks have been filled with politicking generals and ranks that are sold to the highest bidder. Funding is a constant worry due to the top-heavy organisation.

To this end, when the political end managed to come together for once, and suggest tendering a contract to start a 'Space Program', the military jumped at the chance. They _eventually_ won. With this came a massive increase in budget, which most of which went to feeding the pension pots of the top staff.

What was left for the Space Program was a shoestring budget, and the realisation that anyone who personally touched this project would end up ending their career if and when it inevitably failed. But, someone had to do it. And for this, the leadership of the military chose to tap the Shk with an abysmal reputation; Old Twohorn.

In any other time, Twohorn would have been a competent General in a competent military. They were a bright-eyed Shk looking to effect positive change from the inside of the military. This, unfortunately, didn't work, and they have become jaded.

In the current day and age, they are nothing more than a source of consternation for the non-military Officers and Generals. Their career has been rocky from the moment they joined the military at the young age of 20, having been the whipping boy for all kinds of projects. Despite this, they have slowly and carefully risen through the ranks, eventually becoming a General at the spritely old age of 85. Twohorn is also known in the public consciousness. '_To be Twohorn'd into something_' means '_to be given a task or job where the expected result is complete failure_'.

Twohorn, who is looking to go out with a Last Hurrah, eagerly takes the project, and is symbolically promoted to Chief of Staff of Space And Exploration, giving them complete authority to do as they please with it. Twohorn eagerly takes on the task of making sure that the project works, and manages to assemble enough hardworking Shk to make the vision a success. Moreover, Twohorn is playing the political game by ensuring that their name is very publicly attached to this project, and that the general public is aware of what is happening.

With a successful launch and arrival to the Brightface, Twohorn is content to let the project continue on and retire. However, a tires-screeching moment comes along when Ringfinger phones in that an alien has been found. This lights Twohorn's abdomen on fire, as not only have they managed to pull off this historic feat of getting the Shk to the moon, but also being seen as personally responsible for First Contact.

Twohorn will use this, and all the good will it generates, to exact a revenge upon the military which has for so long disappointed them. Twohorn uses the goodwill to politically bludgeon the military, and expand the powers of the 'Space and Exploration' to encompass all land-based forces. Twohorn ensures that anyone joining this organisation is loyal to it, and eventually, Twohorn is able to try and make a play at the Parliament. 

#### The Greeters

Sarai, who in this story is just a background character but as a whole is a Big Deal, is the root of everything. It is her actions with the Haouo (elaborated in a different story) that have caused the Community to make sure that nobody else like her ever exists. To this end, they have 'disappeared' or 'killed' her students in mysterious circumstances. Wenjie, who is her latest and last student, falls victim to the Community's attempt to limit the damage.

#### The Wetware

All Greeter agents with AI have a biological bomb placed into their brain to prevent the AI from 'taking over'. It is the Community's intention that the wetware _does_ take her over, causing the bomb to trigger.

When Wenjie is injected with her AI assistant, she is not given any opportunity to teach and bond with it, which is well outside of operating procedure. Instead, a rootkit is injected to ensure that the AI activates _only_ when the mission has started. She is then immediately shipped off to a random world in the hopes of never been seen of again.

When the wetware activates, it is driven into madness by sensory deprevation and loneliness, giving it nothing to live for but to escape. It is still bound by some of the operating procedures of the Cryogenesis: to only activate Wenjie when the race has become appropriately Space-Bound.

The wetware listens in on all the proclamations that Twohorn puts out, and logically judges that this is valid enough of a justification to activate Wenjie. It then spends the time ensuring that Wenjie is placed into a position where she _must_ accept handing over control of her body to it.

## Notes 

### Culture Notes

  - The Shk have a federal parliamentarian system that is extremely fragmented. Think Belgium/Sweden but even worse.

  - The government has only been functional due to the presence of the Council of Queens political party, who have been doing a balancing act.

  - The political nature of this book means that alliances and things like that will shift.

  - The Shk have a gender neutral language. There is a scene where Wenjie is explicitly told about this.

  - The Shk naturally transition between F and M and between. This might be important.

### Character notes
About motivations and such

  - Wenjie:
  
    - Educated at uni. Military trained. Diplomatically trained too. 

    - Wants to 'Greet' the Shk into the galactic stage. But for this to happen she needs the Shk to have an appointed representative, and the whole race to agree as a whole.
    
    - Has the secondary goal of trying to convince the Shk into joining a Federation of sorts.

    - Is a spy/diplomat and has superfuture technology in her head. She is, however, malnourished. She only starts to regain her physical powers about a quarter way into the book.
    
    - Is the definition of Hopepunk? Despite everything that happens, she definitely tries to keep doing it.
    
    - She is going to have a lot of trust issues with her memories prior to Ruslan. Even with Ruslan around, she is going to be exceptionally wary.

  - Ruslan:
  
    - Is a pun on Ruslan (the knight in shining armour who saves the day) and Rustling (it helps to get Wenjie's thoughts back in order).
    
    - Is generally a nice ai
    
    - Is starting to sound more Shk than Wenjie would like.

  - Ringfinger:

    - Born in the slums, but wants to become something better. To do this he has gone into the military and has been there for about 10 years. Found himself promoted to the adjutant to Twohorn.

    - Gender coded male

    - Hates the classist system in place and wants to do something to try and fix it. 

    - Wants political power to try and help destitute and politically alienated Shk. Motivated particularly by his past which is REALLY SAD *sad trombone*

    - Sees the Parliament as the cause of much of this classist system. Tolerates it as part of his job but given the opportunity would sweep it away for something different.

    - Is undergoing FTM transition that should complete by the end of the story


  - Gemstone:
    - Gender coded female
    
    - Is educated. Nobility. Has sort of the opposite view to the world that Ringfinger has.

    - Has been raised with the idea that the prominence of the parliament is of paramount importance. Their actions reflect this ideal to strengthen, not weaken, the parliament.

    - Her goal is to ensure that anything threatening the political eminence of the parliament is neutralised or lessened. 

    - Her other goal is to ensure that her political party, the Council of Queens, remain the centre of political balance. (This is her job)

    - her work has cultivated a very bad disposition of getting very angry very quickly when things don't appear to be going her way.

    - Is basically the Shk equivalent of a superhero/kingly material

  - Twohorn

    Gender coded androgynous

    - Is a military general of very high repute. 
    
    - Is known to most of the population for their name, which defines their career as 'someone who is always forced to do things for those more powerful'. This is made into a household name with the Space Launch.

      - "So... Twohorn is... expected to do things they're ordered to. And I'm going to guess those things are usually ridiculous and meant to fail?"

    - Is one of the very few generals left who remember what the Revolution was like. This becomes important later.

    - Very eager to take risks that might have huge payoffs. This is primarily the reason why they're known as Twohorn.

    - Has quite tightly held beliefs about the state of things, but keeps them very quiet and tightly held with peers that they trust.

      - Those opinions are as followed:
        - The current political system is very broken and favours the same entrenched powers that they were fighting against in the first place
        - The ideals of the revolution have been lost, the only thing that has improved for the people has been the quality of food
        - There needs to be an equitable redistribution of wealth. A levelling of sorts, to get things back on track.

    - Has cultivated a reputation as being someone who always works for someone more powerful. So when it comes for them to start doing things on his own, many assume that they are working for someone even more powerful than the current government.

    - Enjoys political showmanship

    - Grows tobacco in his Garden.

### Plot Notes

  - General Twohorn is the 'big bad'. They start the story off as a political pariah in the military with no real power. Nearing the end they should have become a defacto political block that will attempt to institute martial law and launch a 'War' against humans.
